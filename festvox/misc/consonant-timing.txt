this is where the consonants are split (at least by Xavier)

start is at the start of the plosive sound. 
middle is the middle of the consonant phoneme.

p	start
t	start
k	start
f	middle
b	start
d	start
g	start
v	middle
s	middle
z	middle
c	middle
j	middle
x	middle
m	middle
n	middle
l	middle
r	middle
h	middle

This is how tsali splits plosives:
  v-Beginning of closing stage
##                   ##
##                || ##
##----------------||###
##                || ##
##                   ##
^ Vowel           ^ Explosion
         ^ Cut here  ^ Vowel

The cruddy ASCII art represents the archetypal case of the voiceless plosive
between two vowels. But it should *always* be safe to split in the middle of
the closing stage.
