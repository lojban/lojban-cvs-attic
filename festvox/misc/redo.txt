this is an onging list of diphones that should be re-recorded, if ever 
presented with an oppertunity for such.

some of *-ii and ii-*
s-iu
x-au
h-au
h-ue
d-iy
g-iy
d-uy

a-x
x-a
(For now, replace these with o-x and x-o, respectively. The vowels o and a should be sufficiently close that the splice between o and a sounds more intelligible than the wrong x consonant.)
