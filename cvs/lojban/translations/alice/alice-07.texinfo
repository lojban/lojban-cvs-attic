@c                             A Mad Tea-Party
                            fenki ke tcati te salci



@c      There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,
@c    and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a
@c    Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two
@c    were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking
@c    over its head.  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;
@c    `only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'
 
i lo jubme cu bredi ni'a lo tricu ca'u le zdani i ko'a goi la cibmoimasti

se pensi la alis i lu i ku'i ru'a va'o le nu sipna kei sy na kurji li'u


@c      The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded
@c    together at one corner of it:  `No room!  No room!' they cried
@c    out when they saw Alice coming.  `There's PLENTY of room!' said
@c    Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one
@c    end of the table.

i le jubme cu barda i ku'i le cimei cu tagji jmaji le kojna be jy i lu

@c      `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

i lu e'e cpacu lo vanju li'u la cibmoimasti cicyractu cu se cusku co zanru


@c      Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it
@c    but tea.  `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.

i la alis catlu le pirosi'e be le jubme i ku'i no na'e tcati jy cpana
i lu mi na viska lo vanju li'u pinka fi abu


@c      `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.

i lu noda zvati li'u se cusku cycy


@c      `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice
@c    angrily.


i lu o'onai va'o la'e di'u na clite fa do le nu friti li'u fengu 
se cusku la alis


@c      `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being
@c    invited,' said the March Hare.

i lu na clite fa do le nu tsebi'o secau le nu se xlura li'u se cusku cycy


@c      `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a
@c    great many more than three.'

i lu mi na pu djuno le du'u le jubme cu me ba'e domoi li'u se cusku
la alis i lu jy bredi tu'a lo za'usai cimei li'u   


@c      `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.  He had been
@c    looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was
@c    his first speech.


i lu le do kerfa cu nitcu le nu katna li'u cu se cusku la mapypre
i my pu ze'u mutce kucli catlu la alis i ra pamoi lei nu my tavla  


@c      `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said
@c    with some severity; `it's very rude.'

i lu ei do cilre le nu na cusku loi prenu pinka li'u la alis se cusku
co junri i lu mutce tolclite li'u


@c      The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all
@c    he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'

i la mapypre cu kargau lei kanla ja'e le nu mutce ganra kei ca le nu
tirna di'u i ku'i my cusku lu ma te simsa lo'e cipnrkorvi lo'e ciska 
jubme li'u po'o


@c      `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad
@c    they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she
@c    added aloud.

i lu ui mi ze'aba se zdile li'u se pensi la alis i lu mi gleki le nu
ko'a co'a preti fa loi se manci nabmi li'u ibabo lu mi jinvi le du'u 
mi ka'e smadi la'e di'ukau li'u se bacru abu


@c      `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'
@c    said the March Hare.

i lu xu do skudji le du'u do jinvi le du'u do ka'e facki le danfu be 
di'u li'u se cusku cycy

@c      `Exactly so,' said Alice.

i lu go'isai li'u se cusku la alis


@c      `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.

i lu ei do cusku le do se skudji li'u cycy stali se cusku


@c      `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what
@c    I say--that's the same thing, you know.'

i lu mi go'i li'u la alis sutra se spuda i lu i y ju'oru'e y i 
mi skudji le mi se cusku i la'e di'u mintu li'u


@c      `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter.  `You might just
@c    as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat
@c    what I see"!'

i lu na mintu li'u se cusku la mapypre i lu i do du'i ka'e cusku 
le du'u lu mi viska le mi se citka li'u mintu lu mi citka le mi
se viska li'u li'u


@c      `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I
@c    like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'

i lu do du'i ka'e cusku sei la cibmoimasti cicractu cu jmina le du'u
lu mi nelci le mi se cpacu li'u mintu lu mi cpacu le mi se nelci li'u li'u


@c      `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to
@c    be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the
@c    same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'

i lu do du'i ka'e cusku sei la sipsmacu noi simlu le ka sipna tavla 
cu jmina le du'u lu mi vasxu ca le nu sipna li'u mintu lu mi sipna
ca le nu vasxu li'u  


@c      `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
@c    conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,
@c    while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
@c    writing-desks, which wasn't much.

i lu ja'a mintu sera'a do li'u se cusku la mapypre i le nunsnu ca 
te denpa i lei kansi'u cu smaji zutse ze'a lo mentu ze'a le nu la alis
pensi piro da poi abu morji ke'a lo'e cipnrkorvi a lo'e ciska jubme
zi'e noi na mutce

 
@c      The Hatter was the first to break the silence.  `What day of
@c    the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice:  he had taken his
@c    watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking
@c    it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.

i la mapypre cu pamoi le ka co'u smaji i lu le xomoi be le masti cu 
detri li'u my se cusku fa'a la alis i my le junla ba'o cpacu le daski
gi'e ca'o xanka catlu gi'e di'inai desygau gi'ebabo punji le my kerlo


@c      Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'

i la alis ze'i pensi gi'e ba cusku lu le vomoi li'u  


@c      `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.  `I told you butter
@c    wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March
@c    Hare.


i lu oiri'e srera la'u lo djedi be li re li'u se cusku la mapypre i 
lu mi pu cusku le du'u lo matne na mapti le minji li'u my se jmina ca 
le nu fengu catlu la cibmeimasti cicractu


@c      `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied. 

i lu ra ba'e xagrai le ka matne li'u cycy cumla spuda


@c      `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter
@c    grumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'

i lu go'i i ku'i la'a loi nanba spisa ji'a cu nerbi'o li'u la mapypre 
cu se pante i lu einai do ra pu setca sepi'o le nanba dakfu li'u


@c      The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then
@c    he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he
@c    could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It
@c    was the BEST butter, you know.'

la cibmeimasti cicracti le junla cu jgari gi'e tolgei catlu gi'eba
jirgau le kabri tcati gi'e rere'u catlu i ku'i cycy ka'enai pensi lo 
se cusku poi xagmau le pamoi pinka po'u lu ro'a ra ba'e xagrai le ka 
matne li'u


@c      Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.
@c    `What a funny watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the
@c    month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'

i la alis pu ca'o kucli catlu ga'u le cycy janco i lu a'u xajmi junla
li'u fi abu pinka i lu ue jy cusku le du'u le xokaumoi be le masti cu
detri enai ku'i le du'u makau tcika li'u


@c      `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.  `Does YOUR watch tell
@c    you what year it is?'

i lu ma krinu le nu ei go'i li'u se cusku la mapypre i lu xu le ba'e 
do junla cu cusku le du'u le xokaumoi nanca cu detri li'u


@c      `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's
@c    because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'

i lu li'a na go'i li'u la alis se spuda co mutce sutra i lu i ku'i
la'e di'u se krinu le nu ze'u stali fa le pa nanca li'u


@c      `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.

i lu mi'u le me ba'e mimoi li'u se cusku la mapypre


@c      Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatter's remark seemed to
@c    have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
@c    `I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she
@c    could.

i la alis cinmo le ka mutce se cfipu i le pinka be fi la mapypre cu
simlu le ka noda smuni ke'a kei gi'e ku'i ja'a lojbo i lu mi na mulno
jimpe li'u abu se cusku rai le ka clite


@c      `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured
@c    a little hot tea upon its nose.

i la mapypre cusku lu le sipsmacu za'ure'u sipna li'u gi'e falcru 
piso'u glare tcati le my nazbi 


@c      The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without
@c    opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to
@c    remark myself.'

i le sipsmacu cu tolsurla desygau le stedu gi'e cusku secau le nu 
kargau le kanla kei lu li'a li'a i di'usai pu'o pinka fi mi li'u 


@c      `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to
@c    Alice again.

i lu xu do ba'o smadi tu'a le manci nabmi li'u la mapypre cu se cusku
ca le nu za'ure'u farna la alis 


@c      `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'

i lu na go'i i mi te jinga li'u la alis se spuda i lu ma danfu li'u


@c      `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.

i lu le ji'asai cmarai di'u mi na sidbo li'u se cusku la mapypre 

@c      `Nor I,' said the March Hare.

i lu go'ira'o li'u se cusku la cibmoimasti cicractu


@c      Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better
@c    with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that
@c    have no answers.'

i la alis cu tatpi patyva'u i lu pe'i do ka'e se prali le temci sei 
abu cusku ta'i lo xagmau be le nu xaksu ty ta'i le nu preti fa lo manci 
nabmi poi na se danfu 


@c      `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you
@c    wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'

i lu va'oda'i le nu la temci cu slabu do pedu'i mi kei sei la mapypre
cusku do na pilno zo le le nu cmene ty i zo la mapti li'u 


@c      `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.

i lu mi na jimpe le du'u do skudji makau li'u se cusku la alis 


@c      `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head
@c    contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'

i lu li'a do na go'i li'u la mapypre se cusku ca le nu tolsi'a
muvgau le stedu i lu la'a do noroi tavla ji'asai la temci li'u


@c      `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to
@c    beat time when I learn music.'

i lu ieru'e li'u la alis kajde se spuda i lu i ku'i ju'o ei mi
darxi do'e le temci ca le nu mi cilre le nu se zgike li'u


@c      `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand
@c    beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do
@c    almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose
@c    it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:
@c    you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
@c    clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'

i lu ua la'e di'u ve ciksi li'u se cusku la mapypre i lu ty na

@c      (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a
@c    whisper.)

to lu au go'i li'u la cibmoimasti cicractu se ke sevzi cusku co
tolcladu toi


@c      `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:
@c    `but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'

i lu la'e di'u da'i banli ju'o li'u se cusku co pensi la alis i 
lu i ku'i va'oku mi na xagji li'u
 

@c      `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep
@c    it to half-past one as long as you liked.'

i lu ieru'e go'i ca le cfari li'u se cusku la mapypre i lu i ku'i e'e
li pacipimu za'o tcika ze'u lo do se djica li'u 


@c      `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.

i lu xu la'e di'u tadji le nu ba'e do zukte li'u preti fi la alis


@c      The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' he replied.
@c    `We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'
@c    (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the
@c    great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

i la mapypre cu tolgei desygau le stedu i lu na go'i li'u my se spuda
i lu mi'a da'arsi'u ca le puzi cibmoimasti ibazibo ty fenki binxo

@c                "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
@c                How I wonder what you're at!"

@c    You know the song, perhaps?'

i lu le selsanga do slabu ti'epei li'u

@c      `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.

@c      `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--

@c                "Up above the world you fly,
@c                Like a tea-tray in the sky.
@c                        Twinkle, twinkle--"'

@c    Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
@c    `Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that
@c    they had to pinch it to make it stop.

@c      `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,
@c    `when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the
@c    time!  Off with his head!"'

@c      `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.

@c      `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,
@c    `he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'

@c      A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so
@c    many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.

@c      `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always
@c    tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'

@c      `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.

@c      `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'

@c      `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice
@c    ventured to ask.

@c      `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,
@c    yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady
@c    tells us a story.'

@c      `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at
@c    the proposal.

@c      `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,
@c    Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.

@c      The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he
@c    said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows
@c    were saying.'

@c      `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.

@c      `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.

@c      `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep
@c    again before it's done.'

@c      `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the
@c    Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,
@c    Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'

@c      `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great
@c    interest in questions of eating and drinking.

@c      `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a
@c    minute or two.

@c      `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently
@c    remarked; `they'd have been ill.'

@c      `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'

@c      Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways
@c    of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went
@c    on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

@c      `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very
@c    earnestly.

@c      `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so
@c    I can't take more.'

@c      `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very
@c    easy to take MORE than nothing.'

@c      `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.

@c      `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked
@c    triumphantly.

@c      Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped
@c    herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the
@c    Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the
@c    bottom of a well?'

@c      The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and
@c    then said, `It was a treacle-well.'

@c      `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but
@c    the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse
@c    sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the
@c    story for yourself.'

@c      `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt
@c    again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'

@c      `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he
@c    consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they
@c    were learning to draw, you know--'

@c      `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

@c      `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this
@c    time.

@c      `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move
@c    one place on.'

@c      He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the
@c    March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather
@c    unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the
@c    only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a
@c    good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset
@c    the milk-jug into his plate.

@c      Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began
@c    very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw
@c    the treacle from?'

@c      `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so
@c    I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,
@c    stupid?'

@c      `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not
@c    choosing to notice this last remark.

@c      `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'

@c      This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse
@c    go on for some time without interrupting it.

@c      `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and
@c    rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew
@c    all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'

@c      `Why with an M?' said Alice.

@c      `Why not?' said the March Hare.

@c      Alice was silent.

@c      The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going
@c    off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up
@c    again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an
@c    M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--
@c    you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever
@c    see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'

@c      `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I
@c    don't think--'

@c      `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.

@c      This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got
@c    up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep
@c    instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her
@c    going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that
@c    they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were
@c    trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

@c      `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she
@c    picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I
@c    ever was at in all my life!'

@c      Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a
@c    door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.
@c    `But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at once.'
@c    And in she went.

@c      Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the
@c    little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,'
@c    she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,
@c    and unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went
@c    to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it
@c    in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down
