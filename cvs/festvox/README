This is the Lojban Text-to-Speech project
$Id$

The goal is to create a voice for Festival that can speak any valid 
lojban text. (It should hopefully be able to handle other languages as 
well using language shifts and other Festival voices. That is the 
future.) 

IMPORTANT:
You should grab a copy of the wav files of the diphones here:

http://www.lojban.org/twiki/pub/Files/SoundFiles/akwavs.zip

and decompress them into 
    festvox/ljb_diphone/wav/ 


The tools used in making the voice are as follows:

* Festival - The open-source text-to-speech engine that will eventually 
             speak everything for us. 
* Festvox  - Festival's voice development package. This is used to build 
             various component of the voice database
See below for information on acquiring these two.
* Praat    - A wonderful tool for maniuplating, analyzing and generally 
             poking at sound files in a phonetic nature. 
             http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/
* Perl     - used for converting Praat files to something Festival 
             understands. 

Festival and Festvox can be acquired from http://www.festvox.org/ 
There's a great wealth of information on the website, but the most 
important (or at least helpful to making this voice) have been:

lojban doesn't need a lexicon, so this was used:

and of course, some info on the synthesizer we're using:
