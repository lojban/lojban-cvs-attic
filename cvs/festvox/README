This is the Lojban Text-to-Speech project

The goal is to create a voice for Festival that can speak any valid 
lojban text. (It should hopefully be able to handle other languages as 
well using language shifts and other Festival voices. That is the 
future.) 

The tools used here are as follows:

* Festival - the open-source text-to-speech engine that will eventually 
             speak everything for us
* Festvox  - Festival's voice development package. This is used to build 
             various component of the voice database

both of these can be acquired from http://www.festvox.org/

* Praat    - A wonderful tool for maniuplating, analyzing and generally 
             poking at sound files in a phonetic nature. 
* Perl     - used for converting Praat files to something Festival 
             understands.
