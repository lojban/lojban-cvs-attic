This is an intermediate Lojban voice for the Festival speech synthesis
system.  THIS IS NOT part of the "official" Lojban TTS.  It's just
something which will work acceptably until such time as the offical TTS
is finished.  This voice should perform better, in several respects,
than the ked voice which has been floating around.

The "festvox/" directory contains the Lojban voice kal_diphone_jbo_us1.

The "vocabsay/" directory contains Festival scripts for creating
vocabulary tapes/CDs.
