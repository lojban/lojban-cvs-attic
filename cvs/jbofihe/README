COMPILING

You need the following tools/libraries installed to have a hope of
building the software :

- bison (yacc probably OK, edit the makefile)
- flex (lex probably OK, ditto)
- an ANSI C compiler (gcc recommended)
- perl
- make (GNU make recommended)

I would guess a Unix (or maybe Win32) system is probably necessary, as
I've hardly tried to be economical with the memory footprint.  I'd be
quite surprised if this builds/runs on a bare DOS system.  It was
developed on Linux on a 486/120 with 32Mb of RAM.

The following tools are recommended but not essential
- LaTeX (to format the highest quality outputs from the s/w)
- a web browser (to display the intermediate quality output)

Download the wordlists (gismu, cmavo, lujvo-list etc) separately from
ftp://xiron.pc.helsinki.fi/pub/lojban/wordlists.

The file sizes in bytes of the versions I'm using are as follows

 808959 NORALUJV.txt
 143391 cmavo
 365437 gismu
 292281 lujvo-list
  75751 oblique.key
  49440 rafsi

and their md5 checksums are

It's best if these are in the build directory or a 'sibling' of it,
although config.pl will find them anywhere in your directory tree
otherwise.

The build sequence looks like this (assuming you want to install under
/usr/local)

perl config.pl --prefix=/usr/local
make all
make install

RUNNING

If your compiled dictionary is not in the default location (i.e. you
are not installing properly or want to use a private local
dictionary), set the JBOFIHE_DICTIONARY environment variable to where
you have installed jbosmujmaji.

The command line is documented in the jbofihe manual page.

The lojban text to be parsed/glossed is supplied on stdin, e.g. if
you've a file called sample

./jbofihe -l -b < sample > sample.tex
latex sample.tex
xdvi sample.dvi

Three other programs are bundled :

cmafihe - a less feature-ful glosser which supplies no grammatical
structure to the output but can cope with grammatically faulty input.

smujajgau - program to build the binary dictionary

jvocuhadju - program to select the preferred lujvo form for a
particular tanru.

FAQ

1. Why is it called 'jbofihe' (i.e. jbofi'e = Lojbanic fish)?

The name is modelled on 'Babelfish', the Altavista translation page on
the WWW.  Sorry, I couldn't come up with anything more creative for
now.
