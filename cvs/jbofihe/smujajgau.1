.B jbofihe
Checks Lojban grammar checker and provides English translations of the
individual words.

.SH FILES
.TP

This file is the default location where
.I jbofihe
and
.I cmafihe
expect to find the dictionary.  It should therefore be the default first argument to smujajgau (unless the software was installed to an alternative location.)
.SH SPECIAL TRANSLATION FORMATS
Dictionary entries for brivla (gismu & lujvo) are expected to provide
entries for each place of the word.  The English translation should
indicate the type of the word and the translation.  The types are
shown in the following table.  In addition, the gloss for a
translation X is shown depending on the context where it will arise in
the translation.  These defaults may be overridden.

.TE

To specify the dictionary entries, the lojban should take the form
'brivlaN', where brivla is the word and N is the place number.  One of
the following may be suffixed to provide an override of the defaults
in the table : n v a or t (for noun, verb, adjective, tag
respectively.)

As an example, 'nanmu' might have entries
.PP
nanmu1:D;man
.PP
nanmu1n:D;man/men

.PP
whereas 'nandu' might have the definition
.PP
nandu1:P;difficulty
.PP
nandu2:I;have* difficulty
.PP
nandu3:S;conditions for difficulty
.PP
nandu3t:under conditions

a '*' is used in the places where the affixed -s, -er and -ing should
be applied (instead of putting them at the end of the English
translation, which is the default.)

The 'places.dat' file included in the distribution shows many
examples.

For cmavo, there are special forms used for certain selma'o,
particular tenses.  These allow dependence on the context in which the
cmavo is used.  Logical connectives are also defined in a special way.
The file 'extradict' in the distribution provides examples.

(More documentation is required!)
