<answer>
<para><indexterm id="idx400" significance="preferred" class="startofrange">
<primary>Sapir&ndash;Whorf hypothesis</primary>
</indexterm>The Sapir&ndash;Whorf hypothesis is the notion that the language you speak
affects the way you think. Most people who have learnt a foreign language,
or have grown up speaking two languages, will be familiar with this idea,
having found themselves thinking and speaking in one language or the other
because something is easier to say in that language. One of the main ideas
behind the Loglan/Lojban project was to create a language which is both
highly expressive and as culturally neutral as possible, then see what
people from different cultures do with it. To give an example, in most
European languages time and gender are very important &mdash; you can say
<quote>She goes</quote>, <quote>It went</quote>, <quote>He'll go</quote>
and so on, but just to say <quote>She/he/it go</quote>, with no particular
gender or time in mind, sounds strange. In Chinese, on the other hand,
<foreignphrase lang="zho">ta qu</foreignphrase> (<quote
role="gloss">he/she/it go</quote>) is perfectly normal. In Lojban there are plenty
of words to show the time of an action, its length, how it happens and so
on &mdash; but you don't have to use any of them. If you really wanted to,
you could say:

<informalexample>
<literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">le ninmu puzuze'udi'i klama</foreignphrase>
the female-human past-long-time-distance-long-time-interval-regularly go
<wordasword>A long time ago, for a long time, she went regularly.</wordasword></literallayout>
</informalexample>
But you can equally well say:

<informalexample>
<literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">klama</foreignphrase>
[someone/something] go </literallayout>
</informalexample></para>

<para>Notice that you can translate the first example into English
(more-or-less) but the second one just won't go into English, or most
European languages. If you're European and this strikes you as odd, you
may have just witnessed a Sapir&ndash;Whorf effect! Understanding the potential
for Sapir&ndash;Whorf effects may lead to better inter-cultural understanding,
promoting communication and peace. </para>


<para>It is known that people's ideas and thought change somewhat when they
learn a foreign language. It is not known whether this change is due to
exposure to a different culture or even just getting outside of ones own
culture. It is also not known how much (if any) of the change is due to
the nature of the language, as opposed to the cultural associations. 
</para>


<para>The Sapir&ndash;Whorf hypothesis was important in linguistics in the 1950s,
but interest fell off partially because testing it properly was so
difficult. Lojban allows a new approach to such testing. Obviously, if a
culture-independent language could be taught to groups of people, the
effects of language could more easily be separated from those of culture. 
</para>


<para>Unique features of Lojban remove constraints on language in the areas
of logic, ambiguity, and expressive power, opening up areas of thought that
have not been easily accessible to human language before. Meanwhile, the
formal rigidity of the language definition allows speakers to carefully
control their expressions (and perhaps therefore their thought processes). 
This gives some measure of predictive power that can be used in designing
and preparing for actual Sapir&ndash;Whorf experiments. </para>


<para>One of the prerequisites of a Sapir&ndash;Whorf experiment is an
international body of Lojban speakers. We need to be able to teach Lojban
to subjects who know only their native (non-English) tongue, and we need to
know in advance the difficulties that people from each language and culture
will have in learning Lojban. Thus, the Lojban community is actively
reaching out to speakers of languages other than English. </para>


<para>Lojban does not need to prove or disprove the Sapir&ndash;Whorf hypothesis
in order to be successful. However, if evidence is produced supporting the
Sapir&ndash;Whorf effect, Lojban will likely be perceived as an outstanding tool
of analytical and creative thought.<indexterm id="idx401" startref="idx400" significance="preferred" class="endofrange"/></para>

</para></question><!--</title>-->

<!--
<answer>
<para><indexterm id="idx402" significance="preferred" class="startofrange">
<primary>linguistic testing</primary>
</indexterm>An artificial language (AL) is a simple model of a natural language. 
It is used for communication like natural languages, simpler, more regular,
and relatively uncontaminated by culture effects. Unlike most natural
languages, an AL has not evolved through naturally processes of internal
change or contact with other languages. In addition, because an AL is pre-defined, the internal structure of the
language is far better known than that of any natural language. </para>


<para>Such a pre-definition, a language <quote role="socalled">prescription</quote><indexterm id="idx404">
<primary>prescription</primary>
</indexterm>, makes an AL a
unique tool for studying the nature of language. As people learn the
language, the way they <quote role="socalled">acquire</quote> understanding of that prescription can
tell scientists how <quote role="socalled">natural</quote> the prescribed forms are. Actual usage of
the language can be compared to the prescription providing quantitative
data on specific patterns of usage. As the language evolves from its
relatively pristine initial state, it may start to deviate from its
prescription. Any such deviations will better inform researchers as to the
properties of a <quote role="socalled">natural</quote> language. The process of language change itself
will of course be open to investigation in a way never before possible. 
Finally, the existence of a relatively complete language prescription at
the birth of the language means that a <quote role="socalled">description</quote> of actual usage after
that initial state can be more simply created, maintained, and studied. 
</para>


<para>Lojban is undoubtedly the most carefully designed and defined AL ever
created. All aspects of its design have been carefully engineered by
several people encompassing expertise in a variety of disciplines,
including linguistics. The language prescription is similarly the most
complete of any language. As such, it serves as a unique basis for the
study of language usage and language change. </para>
-->

<!--<para>--><!--A new language like Lojban, with no native speakers, is termed a
<quote role="socalled">pidgin</quote><indexterm id="idx405">
<primary>pidgin</primary>
</indexterm>. As the language evolves, native speakers of other languages will
learn it, and will bring into their Lojban usage the perspective and
patterns of their native language. This interaction process, called
<quote role="socalled">creolization</quote>, affects all languages, and may be the principle cause of
language change. --><!--As Lojban is learned by speakers of a variety of natural
languages, this process can be studied directly in a way never before
possible, with the language prescription serving as a standard by which
deviations associated with speaker origin, and evolution of usage, can be
measured and described in detail. </para>


<para>An AL like Lojban has neither an associated <quote role="socalled">native accent</quote> nor a
culture base. Being much simpler and more regular than a natural language,
an adult speaker should acquire a fluency seldom achieved when studying a
natural language, and in a relatively short time. Lojban thus makes
possible relatively short-term studies of language learning and language
change. Processes that take generations in natural languages may be
observed in a few years in Lojban speakers. </para>


<para>With the learning of other languages acquiring critical importance in
today's international economy, Lojban provides a tool for researching in
language acquisition.<indexterm id="idx406">
<primary>language acquisition</primary>
</indexterm> Again, Lojban's simplicity allows the results of
such research to be obtained more quickly than in similar studies of
natural language acquisition. </para>


<para>No claim is made that studying Lojban will tell <quote role="socalled">all</quote> about language. 
While Lojban has already seen considerable communicative use, as far as the
rigorous standards of linguistics are concerned it will only be a <quote role="socalled">model</quote>
of a language at least for several decades, whose <quote role="socalled">naturalness</quote> will be
suspect. However, to the extent that Lojban serves the communicative and
expressive functions of human language, any theory about the nature of
human language must apply to Lojban. Language features and processes
identified in studying Lojban can then be confirmed in natural languages. 
Similarly, theories of the nature of language can be tested and refined
against this simpler model of a language before facing the more difficult
and time-consuming testing and analysis involved in natural language
research. </para>


<para>Because Lojban is relatively culture-free,<indexterm id="idx407">
<primary>cultural neutrality</primary>
</indexterm> and because of its
prescribed structure that is consistent with predicate logic, Lojban is an
ideal medium for the analysis and description of other languages. 
Currently, features in language must be compared against other natural
languages, and are usually described in scientific literature by glossed
translation into English. Lojban is simple and regular enough to be
learned and used as a metalanguage for describing other languages; its structures
allow clearer reflection of the patterns of the language being described,
without interference from the competing patterns of English. </para>


<para>It is believed that, for anyone planning to later learn other
languages, the short time spent learning Lojban will be made up by the
reduced time needed later to learn those others. Studies in the 1930s, for
example, demonstrated that students could acquire greater skill in French
through one semester of Esperanto followed by one semester of French, than
they could by a full year course in French. Lojban offers similar
benefits, less likely to be limited to European languages. For example,
structures in Japanese that are difficult to explain in English because
they are so unlike English usage are much easier to explain using Lojban
patterns. Such study can be tied in with concepts of logic, and possibly
with computer-related activities, helping to show the essential
interrelated nature of language and other human endeavor. </para>


<para>Finally, Lojban's predicate grammar makes it eminently suited for
ongoing computer research into natural languages. Lojban can be used for
parsing and analysis, as an internal medium of data storage, or as an
intermediate language for machine translation. Having a combination of
logical and natural language structures, Lojban combines the best of both
major structural approaches to language processing in computers. </para>


<para>The exercise of trying to invent a language can teach us things about
language that probably can't be learned in any other way. Even if Lojban
should fail as a language, we will learn. However, to the extent Lojban
succeeds, its potential as a basis for testing ideas about language, its
structure, and usage, is unlimited. The invention of Lojban is the
invention of the science of experimental linguistics.<indexterm id="idx403" startref="idx402" significance="preferred" class="endofrange"/></para>

<title>Loglan and Lojban: A Linguist's Questions And An Amateur's 
Answers</title><titleabbrev>Loglan and Lojban</titleabbrev>


<para>The following questions about Loglan<indexterm id="idx410">
<primary>Loglan</primary>
</indexterm> are based on a 1969 review by
Arnold M. Zwicky<indexterm id="idx408">
<primary>Zwicky, Arnold M.</primary>
</indexterm> of James Cooke Brown's<indexterm id="idx409">
<primary>Brown, James Cook</primary>
</indexterm> 1966 edition of <citetitle>Loglan
1</citetitle>. Although basically friendly, Zwicky's review raises a large
number of linguistic objections to Loglan as it existed in 1966. The review
represents the only formal notice the linguistics community has ever taken
of the Loglan Project. Unfortunately, the Project has never made any reply.
</para>

<para>The answers that appear here reflect the perspective of Lojban (not
Institute Loglan) as it exists in 1991. Therefore, no attempts have been
made to sort out Zwicky's misunderstandings of Brown's text, Brown's
misunderstandings (or mistakes in writing) about his own language, valid
points as of 1969 that were later changed by Brown, and valid points as
of 1969 that were changed when (or since) Lojban split from Institute
Loglan.</para>

<para>Throughout, <wordasword>Loglan</wordasword> refers to 1966 Loglan as
seen by Zwicky, and <wordasword>Lojban</wordasword> to current Lojban as
seen by me. The word <wordasword>Lojban</wordasword> is derived from the
same metaphor as <wordasword>Loglan</wordasword> (<quote>logical 
language</quote>) but using Lojban words
(<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">logji bangu</foreignphrase>).</para>

<para>As the title indicates, I (John Cowan) am only an amateur (lit. <quote 
role="gloss">lover</quote>) of
linguistics, and I may misinterpret some of Zwicky's points. The
question-and-answer format used here is purely for expository
convenience. Zwicky is not responsible for the form of the questions,
which reflect only my interpretations of his points, except for quoted
text within the questions followed by (Z), which are quotations from
Zwicky's original review. That review was published in

<question>
<para>Lojban sentences do not have unique interpretations; how can Lojban
be said to be unambiguous?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para><indexterm id="idx411" significance="preferred" class="startofrange">
<primary>unambiguous language</primary>
</indexterm>The sense in which Lojban is said to be unambiguous is not a simple
one, and some amplification of the fundamental claim is necessary.
Ambiguity can be judged on four levels: the phonological&ndash;graphical, the
morphological, the syntactic, and the semantic.</para>

<para>Lojban is audio-visually isomorphic<indexterm id="idx413" significance="preferred">
<primary>audio-visual isomorphism</primary>
</indexterm>: the writing system has a
grapheme for every phoneme and vice versa, and there are no supra-segmental
phonemes (such as tones or pitch) which are not represented in the writing
system. Lojban's phonology contains significant pauses that affect word
boundaries, and allows pauses between any two words. The optional written
representation for pause is a period, although pauses can be unambiguously
identified in written text from the morphological rules alone. Lojban also
uses stress significantly, and again there is a written representation
(capitalization of the affected vowel or syllable), which is omitted in
most text, where the morphological default of penultimate stress
applies.</para>

<para>Lojban is morphologically unambiguous in two senses: a string of
phonemes (including explicit pause and stress information) can be broken
up into words in only one way, and each compound word can be converted to
and from the phrase from which it is derived in only one way.</para>

<para>The syntactic unambiguity of Lojban has been established by the use
of a LALR(1) parser generator<indexterm id="idx414">
<primary>grammar, formal</primary>
</indexterm> which, in cooperation with a series of simple
pre-parser operations, produces a unique parse for every Lojban text. In
addition, the existence of a defined <quote role="socalled">phrase
structure rule</quote> grammar underlying the language (and tested via the
parser generator) guarantees that there are no sentences where distinct
deep structures generate isomorphic surface structures.<!-- On the other hand,
Lojban does have transformations, although they are not explicit in the
machine grammar: there are distinct surface structures which have the same
semantics, and therefore reflect the same underlying deep structure.--></para>

<para>The claim for semantic unambiguity is a limited one only. Lojban
contains several constructs which are explicitly ambiguous semantically.
The most important of these are Lojban <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>
(so-called <quote role="socalled">metaphors</quote>)<indexterm id="idx415" class="startofrange">
<primary><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase></primary>
</indexterm> and Lojban names.<indexterm id="idx417">
<primary><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">cmene</emphasis></foreignphrase></primary>
</indexterm>
Names are ambiguous in almost any language, and Lojban is no better; a name
simply must be resolved in context, and the only final authority for the
meaning of a name is the user of the name. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>
are further discussed in later questions.<indexterm id="idx412" startref="idx411" significance="preferred" class="endofrange"/></para> </answer> </qandaentry>

<qandaentry> <question> <para>If the meaning of a particular
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> cannot be completely
understood from understanding the component parts, a separate dictionary
entry is needed for every possible <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>,
making the Lojban dictionary infinitely long. How can this be avoided?
</para> </question>

<answer>
<para></para>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> are binary combinations of
predicates, such that the second predicate is the <quote 
role="socalled">head</quote> and the first
predicate is a modifier for that head. The meaning of the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> is
the meaning of its head, with the additional information that there is some
unspecified relationship between the head and the modifier.</para>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> are the basis of compound
words in Lojban. However, a compound word has a single defined meaning
whereas the meaning of a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> is explicitly ambiguous.
Lojban <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> are not as free as English
figures of speech; they are <quote role="socalled">analytic</quote>,
meaning that the components of the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> do
not themselves assume a figurative sense. Only the connection between them
is unstated.</para>

<para>Most of the constructs of Lojban are semantically unambiguous, and
there are semantically unambiguous ways (such as with relative clauses) to
paraphrase the meaning of any <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>. For example, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">slasi mlatu</foreignphrase> (<quote
role="gloss">plastic-cat</quote>) might be paraphrased in ways that
translate to <quote role="gloss">cat that is made from plastic</quote> or
<quote role="gloss">cat which eats plastic</quote> or various other
interpretations, just as in English. However, the single (compound) word
derived from this <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">slasymlatu</foreignphrase>, has exactly one meaning from
among the interpretations, which could be looked up in a dictionary (if
someone had found the word useful enough to formally submit it). There is
no law compelling the creation of such a word, however, and there is even
an <quote role="socalled">escape mechanism</quote> allowing a speaker to
indicate that a particular instance of a <quote
role="socalled">nonce</quote> compound word is <quote
role="socalled">nonstandard</quote> (has not been checked against a
dictionary or other standard), and may have a meaning based on an unusual
interpretation of the underlying <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>.<indexterm id="idx416" startref="idx415" class="endofrange"/></para> </answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>
The Lojban <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase> seem to have been chosen at random,
without regard to any sort of semantic theory. Why was this done?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para></para>

<para>Lojban content words are built up from a list of around 1350 root
words (<foreignphrase lang= "art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase>),<indexterm id="idx418">
<primary><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase></primary>
</indexterm> which are not necessarily to
be taken as semantically simple. Lojban does not claim to exhibit a
complete and comprehensive semantic theory which hierarchically partitions
the entire semantic space of human discourse. Furthermore, while some
<foreignphrase lang= "art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase> were chosen because they seem to
be semantic primitives, many others (e.g. <foreignphrase lang= "art-lojban">nanmu</foreignphrase>,
meaning <quote role="gloss">adult human male</quote>) are plainly not.</para>

<para>Rather, the 1350-odd root words blanket semantic space, in the sense
that everything human beings talk about can be built up using appropriate
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>. This claim is being tested in
actual usage, and root words can still be added if necessary (after careful
consideration) if genuine gaps are found. For the most part, the few gaps
which are now recognized (about 20 words have been added in the past
decade) reflect the completing of semantic sets. It is no longer permitted
for language users to create new <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase> root words (in the standard
form of the language, at least); newly coined words must fall recognizably
outside the highly regulated <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase> morphological space (a
specific and separate morphological structure is reserved for coined words
&mdash; usually borrowings &mdash; and a marker is available to indicate
that a word is a <quote role="socalled">nonce</quote> coinage rather than
an established <quote role="socalled">dictionary word</quote>).</para>

<para>Lojban's empirically derived word list is similar to that of Basic
English,<indexterm id="idx419">
<primary>Basic English</primary>
</indexterm> which replaces the whole English vocabulary with English-normal
compounds built from about 800 root words. Lojban and Basic English both
allow for the adoption of technical terms from other languages to cover
things like plant and animal names, food names, and names of chemical
compounds.</para>

<!--<para>The unfortunate terms <wordasword>primitive word</wordasword> and
<wordasword>prim</wordasword><indexterm id="idx420">
<primary>primitive word</primary>
</indexterm><indexterm id="idx421">
<primary>prim</primary>
</indexterm> formerly used by the Loglan Project suggested
the notion that Lojban's set of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase> was meant to be a list of
semantic primitives. This is not the case for Lojban, and the more neutral
term <wordasword>root word</wordasword> was adopted recently to reduce
confusion. Lojban predicate words, therefore, are now divided into
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">
root words</quote>, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">lujvo</emphasis></foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">compound
words</quote> and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">fu'ivla</emphasis></foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">borrowings</quote> (lit. <quote role="gloss">copied
words</quote>). (Brown did originally select some words as <quote
role="socalled">semantic primitives</quote>; however, he later added words
with no claim that the additions were <quote
role="socalled">primitive</quote> in the same sense). </para>--></answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>What is the process by which the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase> were devised?
What are some examples of the process and its results?</para></question>

<answer><para>An appropriate term was chosen from each of the six languages used
in the process: Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, Arabic.
(Natural language forms below are given in this order, labeled by
single letters.) In some cases, two different terms from one or another
language was used, to see which would have the highest score. The terms
were then converted to Lojban phonology, with the additional step of
reducing affricates to their corresponding fricatives, to avoid a false match
between the stop portion of a source-language affricate and a Lojban stop.
Morphological affixes were removed, also to avoid false matches.</para>

<para>To score a candidate <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase>, it was compared with each of the six
source-language words to produce six raw scores. The raw score for a
particular source word is roughly the number of letters it has in common
(in the same order) with the candidate gismu. (If there are two or fewer
letters in common, special rules apply.) The raw score was then divided
by the length of the source-language word, and multiplied by a weight
that reflected the relative number of speakers of the source language at
the time the candidate was devised.
The sum of the six adjusted scores is the final score for that candidate
gismu, typically expressed as a percentage.</para>

<para>For example, the candidate <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mamta</foreignphrase> for <quote role="gloss">mother</quote> was built from the
following six source words, in Lojbanized form: C <foreignphrase lang="zho">ma</foreignphrase>, E <foreignphrase lang="eng">mam</foreignphrase>, H <foreignphrase lang="hin">mata</foreignphrase>,
S <foreignphrase lang="spa">mam</foreignphrase>, R <foreignphrase lang="rus">mat</foreignphrase>, A <foreignphrase lang="ara">am</foreignphrase>. (The English forms are based on American English
pronunciation and lexis.) The raw scores are 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, and 2
respectively, leading to a final score of 100%.  This word cannot be
improved on!</para>      

<para>At the other end of the spectrum is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ciblu</foreignphrase>, the Lojban gismu for
<quote role="gloss">blood</quote>. The source words here were C <foreignphrase lang="zho">ciue</foreignphrase>, E <foreignphrase lang="eng">blad</foreignphrase>, H <foreignphrase lang="hin">rakt</foreignphrase>, S <foreignphrase lang="spa">sangr</foreignphrase>,
R <foreignphrase lang="rus">krof</foreignphrase>, A <foreignphrase lang="ara">dam</foreignphrase>. The raw scores are 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0 respectively; the
adjusted scores are 0.27, 0.105, 0, 0, 0, 0; and the final score is 37.5%.
This is quite low, since it reflects only the Chinese and English sources,
but was still superior to all other possibilities.</para>

<para>The gismu <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cukta</foreignphrase>, meaning <quote role="gloss">book</quote>, works out considerably better.
Its sources are C <foreignphrase lang="zho">cu</foreignphrase>, E <foreignphrase lang="eng">buk</foreignphrase>, H <foreignphrase lang="hin">pustak</foreignphrase>, S <foreignphrase lang="spa">libr</foreignphrase>, R <foreignphrase lang="rus">knik</foreignphrase>, A <foreignphrase lang="ara">kitab</foreignphrase>, with raw
scores of 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 3 and a final score of 57.2%. Several different
language families blended nicely to form this word.</para>

<para>Other gismu show similar patterns. <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">prenu</foreignphrase>, for example, meaning
<quote role="gloss">person</quote>, is a mixture of Chinese <foreignphrase lang="zho">ren</foreignphrase> and the <quote role="gloss">person</quote> root used
in English, Spanish, and Russian. <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">vanju</foreignphrase>, for <quote role="gloss">wine</quote> (Lojbanized as
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">vain</foreignphrase>) matches well with every source language except Arabic, and even
with French <foreignphrase lang="fra">vin</foreignphrase> (which would Lojbanize as <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">van</foreignphrase>), which is not a source
language at all. </para>                  

<para>Finally, there is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">jmive</foreignphrase>, the gismu for <quote role="gloss">(a)live</quote>, which owes its form
to a transcription error: the English source word was not Lojbanized to
<foreignphrase lang="eng">laiv</foreignphrase> but left as <foreignphrase lang="eng">live</foreignphrase>.</para>

</indexterm><!--In the early part of the Loglan Project, poor <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>
were regrettably common. In particular, it was common for <foreignphrase

be calques on English expressions, such as <quote role="gloss">beautiful
type of small</quote> for English <wordasword>pretty small</wordasword>.
Many <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> employed the primitive for
<quote role="gloss">make</quote> (in the sense <quote role="gloss">make
from materials</quote>) where <quote role="gloss">cause</quote> would have
been more appropriate (e.g. <wordasword>kill</wordasword> = <quote

gone into removing such <foreignphrase

role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> <foreignphrase

role="gloss">school intended to train girls between 6 and 10 years of age
to play the bassoon</quote>, although if such a school existed it could
certainly be called a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">nixli
ckule</foreignphrase>. This interpretation can be rejected as implausible
because it involves additional restrictive information. The undefined
relationship between <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">nixli</foreignphrase>
and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ckule</foreignphrase> cannot drag in
additional information <quote role="socalled">by the hair</quote>, as it

else a non-<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis

a Lojban relative clause. As a comparision, such interpretations as <quote

Lojban claims to be unambiguous, but many constructs have vague
meanings, and the meanings of the primitives themselves are extremely
poorly specified. On the other hand, Lojban forces precision on speakers
where it is not wanted and where natural-language speakers can easily
avoid it. Is this appropriate to a culturally neutral, unambiguous
language?

</question>

<para></para>

<para><indexterm id="idx424" class="startofrange">
<primary>unambiguous language</primary>
</indexterm>Lojban's avoidance of ambiguity does not mean an avoidance of
vagueness. A Lojban aphorism states that the price of infinite precision
is infinite verbosity, as indeed Wilkins'<indexterm id="idx426">
<primary>Wilkins, John</primary>
</indexterm> Philosophical Language
illustrates. Lojban's allowable vagueness permits useful sentences to be
not much longer than their natural-language counterparts.</para>

<para>There are many ways to omit information in Lojban, and it is up to
the listener to reconstruct what was meant, just as in natural languages.
In each construct, there are specific required and optional components.
Unlike English, omitting an optional component explicitly and
unambiguously flags an ellipsis. Furthermore, the listener has a clear
way of querying any of this elliptically omitted information.</para>

<para>There are also some categories which are necessary in Lojban and not
in other languages. For example, Lojban requires the speaker, whenever
referring to objects, to specify whether the objects are considered as
individuals, as a mass, or as a (set theoretic) set. Likewise, logical
relations are made explicit: there can be no neutrality in Lojban about
inclusive vs. exclusive <wordasword>or</wordasword>, which are no more
closely related semantically than any other pair of logical
connectives.</para>

<para>These properties are a product of Lojban's fundamental design, which
was chosen to emphasize a highly distinctive and non-natural syntax (that
of formal first-order predicate logic)<indexterm id="idx427">
<primary>logic</primary>
</indexterm> embedded in a language with the
same expressive power as natural languages. Through the appearance of
this one highly unusual feature, the intent of the Loglan/Lojban Project has
been to maximize one difference between Lojban and natural languages
without compromising speakability and learnability. This difference
could then be tested by considering whether the use of first-order
predicate logic as a syntactic base aided fluent Lojban speakers in the
use of this logic as a reasoning tool.</para>

then be restricted using <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis

</indexterm>Lojban is predominantly a left-branching language. By default, all
structures are left-branching, with right-branching available when marked
by a particle. Since the head of most constructs appears on the left,
left-branching structures tend to favor the speaker. Nothing spoken needs
to be revised to add more information. When the head is on the right, as in
the case of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>, left-branching may seem
counterintuitive, as it requires the listener to retain the entire
structure in mind until the head is found. However, left-branching was
retained even in <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase> for the sake of
simplicity.</para>

How can Lojban logical connectives be used in imperative sentences?

<answer>
<para></para>

<para><indexterm id="idx441" class="startofrange">
<primary><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ko</foreignphrase></primary>
</indexterm>There is a special imperative pronoun
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ko</foreignphrase>. This is a second
person pronoun logically equivalent to <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">do</foreignphrase>, the normal Lojban word for <quote 
role="gloss">you</quote>, but
conveying an imperative sense. Thus, an imperative can be understood as
commanding the listener to make the assertion true which results when
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ko</foreignphrase> is replaced by
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">do</foreignphrase>.</para>

<para>For example, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ko
sisti</foreignphrase> (<quote role="gloss">Stop!</quote>) is logically
equivalent to <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">do sisti</foreignphrase>
(<quote role="gloss">you stop</quote>), and pragmatically may be understood
as <quote role="gloss">Make <quote><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">do
sisti</foreignphrase></quote> true!</quote>. This allows logical connection to be
used in imperatives without loss of clarity or generality; the logical
connection applies to the assertion which is in effect embedded in the
imperative.</para>

</question>

<answer>

<para><indexterm id="idx444" class="startofrange">
<primary>tense</primary>
</indexterm><!--The Lojban tense system has been greatly elaborated and clarified
with respect to its Loglan predecessor. There are now specific mechanisms
for stating the potentiality or actuality of a predication; in the absence
of these, a predication is neutral concerning the degree of actuality
expressed by it. It is no longer true that <quote 
role="socalled">untensed</quote>
predicates are used to express disposition or habit. They may be so used,
by ellipsis, but are in fact neutral in the absence of further
evidence.</para>

<para>-->Lojban tense, like other incidental modifiers of a predication, tend
to be contextually <quote role="socalled">sticky</quote>. When once
specified in connected discourse, to whatever degree of precision seems
appropriate, tense need not be respecified in each sentence. In narration,
this assumption is modified to the extent that each sentence is assumed to
refer to a slightly later time than the previous sentence, although with
explicit tense markers it is possible to tell a story in reversed or

</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para></para>

<para><indexterm id="idx446" class="startofrange">
<primary>place structure</primary>
</indexterm>Very little. Place structures are empirically derived, like the
<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase> list itself, and present a far more difficult problem;
therefore, they will be standardized (if ever) only after everything else
is complete. There is no sufficiently complete and
general case theory that allows the construction of <foreignphrase 
lang="lat">a priori</foreignphrase> place
structures for the large variety of predicates that exist in the real
world.</para>

<para>The current place structures of Lojban represent a three-way
compromise: fewer places are easier to learn; more places make for more
concision (arguments not represented in the place structure may be added,
but must be marked with appropriate case tags); the presence of an argument
in the place structure makes a metaphysical claim that it is required for
the predication to be meaningful. This last point requires some
explanation. For example, the predicate <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">klama</foreignphrase> (<quote role="gloss">come,
go</quote>) has five places: the actor, the destination, the origin, the
route, and the means. Lojban therefore claims that anything not involving
these five notions (whether specified in a particular sentence or not) is
not an instance of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">klama</foreignphrase>.
The predicate <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cliva</foreignphrase>
(<quote role="gloss">leave</quote>) has the same places except for the
destination; it is not necesssary to be going anywhere in particular for
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cliva</foreignphrase> to hold. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">litru</foreignphrase> (<quote
role="gloss">travel</quote>) has neither origin nor destination, merely,
the actor, the route, and the means. The predicate <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cadzu</foreignphrase> (<quote role="gloss">walk</quote>),
involves a walker, a surface to walk on, and a means of walking (typically legs). One may
walk without an origin or a destination (in circles, e.g.). For describing
the act of walking from somewhere to somewhere, the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban"><emphasis role="term">tanru</emphasis></foreignphrase>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cadzu klama</foreignphrase> or the

</indexterm>There are four stages of borrowing in Lojban, as words become more
and more modified (but shorter and easier to use). Stage 1 is the use
of a foreign name quoted with the cmavo <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la'o</foreignphrase>. For example, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me la'o
ly.  spaghetti .ly.</foreignphrase> is a predicate with the place structure <quote>x<subscript>1</subscript> is a
quantity of spaghetti.</quote> The foreign term is entirely unchanged.
However, it requires five extra syllables and two pauses, and its
pronunciation is uncertain.</para>

<para>Stage 2 involves changing the foreign name to a Lojbanized name: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me la
spagetis.</foreignphrase> This saves three syllables and one pause over Stage 1, and
has a definite Lojban pronunciation. However, it is still awkward to
use repeatedly.</para>

<para>Even so, one of these expedients is often quite sufficient when a word
is needed quickly in conversation. This can make it easier to get by
without a full command of the Lojban vocabulary.</para>

<para>Where a little more universality is desired, the word to be borrowed
must be Lojbanized into one of several permitted forms. A <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis

attached to the beginning of the Lojbanized form, using a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase> or <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">l</foreignphrase> to
ensure that the resulting word doesn't fall apart. The result is a
Stage 3 <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">fu'ivla</emphasis></foreignphrase> such as <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cidjrspageti</foreignphrase>, a true <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis

rather than a phrase.</para>

<para>The <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">rafsi</emphasis></foreignphrase> used in a Stage 3 <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">fu'ivla</emphasis></foreignphrase> categorizes or limits its meaning;
otherwise a word having several different jargon meanings in other
languages would require the word-inventor to choose which meaning should
be assigned to the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">fu'ivla</emphasis></foreignphrase>, since <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">fu'ivla</emphasis></foreignphrase> (like other <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis

present the most common kind of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis

<para>The Lojban phonological system is hard for English-speakers (to say
nothing of Japanese-speakers) to use, due to the large numbers of
consonant clusters and non-English diphthongs. How can a language be
appropriate as an international auxiliary language when it is difficult
to pronounce?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para></para>

<para><indexterm id="idx448" class="startofrange">
<primary>phonology</primary>
</indexterm>Lojban phonology is carefully restricted. There are
only 4 falling and 10 rising diphthongs, and the rising diphthongs
are used only in names and in paralinguistic grunts representing
emotions. All 25 possible vowel combinations are used, but they are separated by
a voiceless vocalic glide written with an apostrophe, thus preventing
diphthongization. English-speakers think of this glide as /h/, and even
speakers of languages like French, which has no /h/, can manage this
sound intervocalically.</para>

<para>Consonant clusters<indexterm id="idx450">
<primary>cluster, consonant</primary>
</indexterm> are carefully controlled as well. Only 48
selected clusters are permitted initially; some of these, such as
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ml</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mr</foreignphrase>, do not appear in English, but are
still possible to English- speakers with a bit of practice. Medial
consonant clusters are also restricted, to prevent mixed voiced&ndash;unvoiced
clusters, consecutive stops, and other hard-to-handle combinations. The
Lojban sound /y/, IPA [<emphasis role="ipa">&schwa;</emphasis>], is used to separate <quote
role="socalled">bad</quote> medial clusters wherever the morphology rules
would otherwise produce them.&IPAASCIIdisclaimer;</para>

<para>Difficulties with the variety of permitted initial sounds are
overestimated. Lojban's morphology makes pronouncing these words easier
than they first appear. Initial consonant clusters occur only in content
words (predicates) and names. These words seldom are spoken in
isolation; rather, they are expressed in a speech stream with a rhythmic
stress pattern preceded (and followed) by words that end with a vowel.
The unambiguous morphology allows the words to be broken apart even if
run together at a very high speech rate. Meanwhile, though, the final
vowel of the preceding word serves to buffer the cluster, allowing it to
be pronounced as a much easier medial cluster.<indexterm id="idx451">
<primary>buffer</primary>
</indexterm> Thus <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le mlatu</foreignphrase> (<quote 
role="socalled">the
cat</quote>), while officially pronounced /le,MLA,tu/, can be pronounced as
/lem,LA,tu/ with no confusion to the listener.</para>

<para>In addition, the buffering sound, IPA [<emphasis role="ipa">&Ibarredipa;</emphasis>] (the
<wordasword>i</wordasword> of English <wordasword>bit</wordasword>) is
explicitly reserved for insertion at any point into a Lojban word where the
speaker requires it for ease of pronunciation. The word <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mlatu</foreignphrase> may be pronounced /m<emphasis role="ipa">&Ibarredipa;</emphasis>latu/ by
those who cannot manage <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ml</foreignphrase>, and nothing else need be changed.

</indexterm>Lojban words only faintly resemble their English cognates.
Most Lojban words are fairly equal mixtures of English and Chinese,
with lesser influences from Spanish, Hindi, Russian, and Arabic.</para>

<para>There is no proven claim that the Lojban word-making algorithm has
any meaningful correlation with learnability of the words. Informal <quote role="socalled">engineering tests</quote>
were conducted early in the Loglan Project, leading to the selection of the
current algorithm, but these tests have never been documented or subjected
to review. The Logical Language Group has proposed formal tests of the
algorithm, and is instrumenting its software used for teaching vocabulary
to allow data to be gathered that will confirm or refute this
hypothesis. Gathering this data may incidentally provide additional
insights into the vocabulary learning process, enabling Lojban to serve the
additional purpose of being a test bed for research in second language
acquisition.</para>

<para>In any event, the word-making algorithm used for Lojban has the clear
benefit of ensuring that phonemes occur in the language in rough proportion
to their occurence in the source natural languages, and in patterns and
orders that are similar to those in the source languages (thus the first
syllable of Lojban <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban"><emphasis
role="term">gismu</emphasis></foreignphrase> most frequently ends in /n/,
reflecting the high frequency of syllable ending /n/ in Chinese). The
result is a language that is much more pleasant-sounding than, for example,
randomly chosen phoneme strings, while having at least some arguable claim
to being free of the European cultural bias found in the roots of most
other constructed languages.<indexterm id="idx453" startref="idx452" class="endofrange"/></para> </answer> </qandaentry>

</indexterm>Lojban is only
secondarily a <quote role="socalled">word order</quote> language at all.
Primarily, it is a particle language. Using a standard word order allows
many of the particles to be <quote role="socalled">elided</quote> (dropped)
in common cases. However, even the standard unmarked word order is by no
means fixed; the principal requirement is that at least one argument
precede the predicate, but it is perfectly all right for all of the
arguments to do so, leading to an SOV word order<indexterm id="idx456">

</indexterm> rather than the canonical
SVO (subject&ndash;verb&ndash;object).<indexterm id="idx455">

In two-argument predicates, OSV, OVS, and VOS are also possible with only

two-place predicates are involved) can also be achieved. </para> </answer>

</indexterm>To some extent, such splitting is inevitable and already exists in
natural languages. Some English-speakers may use the color term <quote

still possible, perhaps with some effort. The Lojban community will have to
work out such problems for itself; there are sufficent clarifying
mechanisms to resolve differences in idiolect or style between individuals.
The unambiguous syntax and other constraints defined in the language
prescription should make such differences much more easily resolvable than,
say, the differences between two dialects of English.</para>

<para>The prescriptive phase of Lojban is not intended to solve all
problems (especially all semantic problems) but merely to provide enough
structure to get a linguistic community started. After that, the language
will be allowed to evolve naturally, and will probably creolize a bit in

those possessed by non-Lojban speakers. If Sapir&ndash;Whorf is false, which

<para>Perhaps not. However, the Sapir&ndash;Whorf hypothesis tends to be

<para>What scientific and linguistic interest can Lojban possibly have,

</question>

<answer>
<para><indexterm id="idx460a" class="startofrange" significance="preferred">
<primary>linguistic testing</primary>
</indexterm>In a highly complex system (which any language, even an artificial
one, is), the interaction of the design features displays properties that
are more than the sum of the parts. Thus it is possible that all
language is merely a system comprised of a bunch of neurons releasing
neurotransmitters. Biochemistry may eventually devise a complete
explanation for the neuronic process<indexterm id="idx460b">
<primary>neuronic process</primary>
</indexterm> (including its genetic components),
and we may then say we <quote>know the design principles of the system.</quote> But
we won't know the system, because the complexity of those neuronic
interactions is so great that knowing the pieces does not give a total
understanding of the system. This indeed may be what defines the
concept of <quote role="socalled">system</quote>.</para>

<para>Knowing all the prescribed rules<indexterm id="idx460c">
<primary>prescription</primary>
</indexterm> of an artificial language does not tell
you how that artificial language is used communicatively. Consider this
question: Given multiple ways of communicating the same idea, do users
of the language choose particular forms over others, and why? This is
similar to a question that is commonly asked about natural languages.</para>
 
<para>However, a simpler system which can be more fully understood may serve
as an excellent model for a less understood, more complex system. Thus
the simpler system could be examined for parallels to hypotheses about
the more complex system. Examination of the simpler system may suggest
properties to look for in the more complex system, or it may even
suggest hypotheses that can be tested in the more complex system.</para>

<para>A hot topic in parts of the Lojban community is whether the language
has, or should have, an underlying semantic theory.<indexterm id="idx460d">
<primary>semantics</primary>
<secondary>semantic theory</secondary>
</indexterm> If one exists, it
is certainly not as developed or prescribed as the syntactic design and
theory. Eliminating syntactic ambiguity allows a more direct
examination of semantic ambiguities, including the properties of
modification and restriction, resolution of anaphora, and identification
of ellipses. Any semantic theories proposed for natural language can be
looked at in terms of semantic usage in the simpler Lojban system.</para>

<para>As a model of a natural language, it seems likely that any theory that
is <emphasis>not</emphasis> true of Lojban is at the very least doubtful with regard
to natural language, thus allowing partial verification of theories. If
the theory is true of natural language, then you have found evidence
that Lojban is in some way unnatural.<indexterm id="idx460ee">
<primary>naturalness</primary>
</indexterm> You then try to explain which of
the (fully-known) design features of Lojban causes this unnaturalness.
By counterexample that design feature is not a feature of natural
languages, demonstrating something about natural language by studying an
artificial one.</para>

<para>As another example, pragmatic effects<indexterm id="idx460e">
<primary>pragmatics</primary>
</indexterm> can be more easily recognized in
the simpler Lojban system, and can be clearly identified as pragmatic.
Thus, insights about pragmatic effects may be more visible in Lojban,
insights that would then be tested in the natural languages.</para>

<question>
<para>Why is Lojban a useful testbed for experimental linguistics?  What
are some plausible experiments that could be done using Lojban?</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>A simple system is easier to perform experiments on than a more
complex system. There are fewer variables, and if the system is
<quote role="socalled">designed</quote>, some things that are variables in complex systems are in
effect tunable constants in the simple, carefully-designed system. You
can then rerun the experiment with minor changes to explore the effects
of those variables.</para>

<para>Experimental linguistics of this kind is virtually unthinkable using the
natural languages. The Sapir&ndash;Whorf Hypothesis<indexterm id="idx460f">
<primary>Sapir&ndash;Whorf hypothesis</primary>
</indexterm> is not really testable,
since we can't control any variables, and we don't know what features of
a language might be determining to a culture. Sapir&ndash;Whorf may be more
testable when you can reduce or even control the variables with a
language like Lojban.</para>

<para>Lojban is a predicate language, with no distinct nouns, verbs, or
adjectives. What are the linguistic (communicative) properties of such
a system? The answer has been partially explored through symbolic
logic.<indexterm id="idx460g">
<primary>logic</primary>
</indexterm> But do people, when thinking linguistically, mimic in any way
the processes of formal logic? What effects would a formal-logic&ndash;based
language have on those linguistic thinking processes? Is the resulting
language susceptible to the same analysis as natural language, in terms
of the various formal systems that have been developed by linguists
over the past few decades?</para>

<para>Given that computer natural language processing<indexterm id="idx460h">
<primary>computer applications</primary>
</indexterm> usually involves
converting natural language to some kind of predicate form from which
deductions can be made, the usefulness of predicate logic as a tool for
such analysis is already accepted. But how does one identify the logical
deductions that a human being makes from a natural language statement?
By thinking in Lojban, one is already thinking using predicate logic
structures, so that the deduction process is much plainer.</para>

<para>If Lojban is shown by experiment to have the systemic properties of a
natural language, and is easier to implement in computational
linguistics research problems, it serves as a tool to bridge those two
disciplines, leading to more rapid and effective natural language
processing. But only if it is tried. Even if it proves less than
ideal, the study of natural language using computational linguistic
techniques and a Lojban-based tool will be instructive in ways not
accessible using any natural language.</para>

<para>Lojban could also be used to study language acquisition.<indexterm id="idx460i">
<primary>language acquisition</primary>
<secondary>testing</secondary>
</indexterm> Take even a few
children during the critical period of language learning and teach them
this artificial language (at the same time as they learn their
traditional language). Do they become truly bilingual? If they are as
fluently communicative in the artificial language as they are in their
natural language, then the artificial language is a suitable linguistic
model. Then, <emphasis>any</emphasis> theory of language that cannot extend to
cover the features of the artificial language is inadequate. You could
perform a series of experiments with ever more exotic artificial
languages (obviously you would need new speakers for each test). Sooner or
later, either the model breaks and the artificial language is no longer
acquirable by children or communicative as a language; or the theory
breaks, and you've learned where to look for improvements in the theory.</para>

<para>With only natural languages, you have to devise theories based on the
available data, and then look in other natural languages for
confirmation or refutation. But this isn't the optimal kind of
experimentation, because you really cannot plan the experiment or control
the variables. (The other language may have the same apparent feature
through a totally different process that you won't recognize because you
aren't looking for it.)</para>

<para>Lojban has a feature that is designed to explore a less-understood
aspect of language &mdash; the direct expression of emotion.<indexterm id="idx460j">
<primary>attitudinals</primary>
</indexterm> Lojban allows
expressive communication of emotions in words without suprasegmentals.
This is presumably unlike all natural languages, but not entirely, as
many languages have a limited set of indicators of attitude in the form
of interjections. Can human beings manipulate the symbols of emotion in
the same way they manipulate the comparable symbols of non-emotional
expression? There is a whole range of experimental questions raised by
this design element, probably the most <quote role="socalled">unnatural</quote> element of Lojban's
design.<indexterm id="idx460k">
<primary>naturalness</primary>
</indexterm></para>

<para>A language like Lojban is an ideal test bed for experimentation, because
it is flexible; you can evolve slightly different versions of the
language very easily by simply changing some features. Delete a
particular construct from the prescription, and do not teach it to a
child. Does the child develop that construct anyway by analogy to other
languages known, or does the child successfully adapt to whatever other
processes you've designed into the language instead of the construct.<indexterm id="idx461a" startref="idx460a" class="endofrange"/></para>

Princeton.</para>

<para>In the book, a picture caption notes that Nootka<indexterm id="idx460l">
<primary>Nootka</primary>
</indexterm> (a Pacific Northwest
language) has the single word <foreignphrase lang="nai">inikwihl'minik'isit</foreignphrase> meaning the
equivalent of the entire English sentence <quote>Several small fires were
burning in the house.</quote> Here is a Lojban sentence closely paralleling
the English:

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">so'i cmalu fagri puca'o    jelca   vine'i    le  zdani</foreignphrase>
Many small fires were-then burning at-within the house.</literallayout>

</informalexample>But here is the sentence as a single word (though not with the same
structure as Nootka)

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">zdane'ikemcmafagyso'ikemprununje'a</foreignphrase>
house-inside-type-of-small-fire-many-type-of-previous-burning</literallayout>

</informalexample>In fact, according to Miller the Nootka breaks down as:

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="nai">inikw     -ihl         -'minih -'is        -it</foreignphrase>
fire/burn in-the-house plural  diminutive  past-tense</literallayout>

</informalexample>This order is also readily expressible in Lojban:

<informalexample><literallayout><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">fagykemzdanerso'icmapru</foreignphrase>
fire-type-of-house-inside-many-small-past-event</literallayout>

</informalexample></para>

<para><indexterm id="idx460m" class="startofrange" significance="preferred">
<primary>linguistic glossing</primary>
</indexterm>In either case, the Lojban more accurately tracks the semantics of the
Nootka, demonstrating the inadequacy of the English. The Nootka word as
broken down did not require two separate semantic elements for <quote role="gloss">fire</quote>
and <quote role="gloss">burn</quote> as did the English version, and the English translation used
the more complicated tense <quote role="gloss">were-burning</quote> instead of the simpler, and
presumably more accurate <quote role="gloss">burned</quote>. It seems clear that in translating
the word-sentence into English, considerable vagueness is introduced.</para>

<para>Lojban cannot, of course, express everything in the natural form of any
language whatever. Lojban has a less-marked syntactic word order, and
expressing other orders requires marking particles that would not be
found in the source language. Thus there is a tradeoff between precise
semantic and syntactic representations.</para>

<para>Still, this example suggests that, as a predicate language, Lojban is a
much more effective tool at studying both the forms and semantics of
other languages than is English, which has its own cultural, syntactic
and semantic complexities to complicate the analysis. This is
especially true for analysis by non-native English speaking linguists &mdash;

<answer>
<para><indexterm id="idx460n" class="startofrange">
<primary>sociolinguistics</primary>
</indexterm>A language that begins with a highly detailed prescription and then
is allowed to drift naturally is an ideal test bed for examining the
processes of language change. In the case of an artificial language
like Lojban, as the speaking community in each culture grows, you can
observe how the language changes in contact with those other languages.
Because of the speed of learning, artificial languages should tend to
show effects more quickly (by being mastered to a communicative level
more quickly). Anecdotal evidence about Esperanto<indexterm id="idx460o">
<primary>Esperanto</primary>
</indexterm> supports this idea.</para>

<para>Does this mean that the conclusions are completely replicable to natural
language evolutionary processes? Obviously not. But again, we are
performing experiments with a model, somewhat idealized, of a natural
language. Unlike a purely theoretical model (as all linguistic theories
must inherently be), Lojban is a model that can be experimented with
using live speakers. Provided that we understand the model as it
evolves, that understanding much more approximates an understanding of
natural language as time goes on.</para>

<para>Furthermore, most numerically and sociologically important languages
have some degree, more or less, of prescription.<indexterm id="idx460p">
<primary>prescription</primary>
</indexterm> Indeed, some natural
languages, such as modern Hebrew, formal Swahili, Mandarin Chinese, and
modern standard Arabic, in certain ways resemble artificial languages,

the effects of prescription on language development and use.</para>

<para><indexterm id="idx460q" class="startofrange">

second-language acquisition. They may also aid in analyzing the
development of different registers (usages based on social class and

reactions to prescriptive environments that constrain language use.</para>

<para>None of these scientific applications of Lojban inherently requires a
large fluent body of speakers, or any solely-native
speaker of that tongue. If any of the less scientific applications of
Lojban provide it with speaker base, the nature of Lojban's usefulness
as a model will change. New applications, not really predictable as
yet, will turn up, aided by our doubtless increased understanding of
language. But the model, even if well understood, no longer is as

<simplesect><title>Summary</title>

<para>Professor Zwicky's analysis raises several points of concern to
linguists who might be interested in the potential use of Lojban for
linguistic research. It is believed that sufficient planning and
linguistic understanding (and occasionally serendipity) has been
incorporated in the Lojban language design process to meet these
concerns. Other concerns no doubt exist; it is believed they can
similarly be addressed, and that Lojban will prove linguistically viable,
as well as useful in our attempts to understand language.
</para>

<para>
Meanwhile, as Lojban has evolved since the 1966 version of Loglan,
new features, not analyzed by Zwicky, have been added to the language,
further enhancing its potential value. These features, such as Lojban's
expression of the several varieties of natural language negation, the
system of attitudinal words for emotional expression, and the discursives
used for metalinguistic manipulation and comment on the discourse in
