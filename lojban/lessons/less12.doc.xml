<sect1 id="less12aspect"><title>Aspect</title>

<para>We've seen that we can locate our <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> in space and time, by using tenses. 
But this is something of a simplification. We can't simply say that events 
are before, simultaneous, or after other events, because events have 
beginnings, middles and ends. They are not simply points that can be lined 
up on a timeline.
</para>

<para>And we tend to be very interested in the beginnings and ends of
events. There is quite a difference between <quote>Is he about to do his
homework?</quote>, <quote>Is he still doing his homework?</quote>, and
<quote>Has he done his homework yet?</quote> Doing homework is an activity
that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. So when we pinpoint the time at
which doing homework happens, we are also pinpointing its beginning, its
middle, and its end. And so, the first question asks whether the
time is before the <emphasis>beginning</emphasis> of doing the homework, or
after it. The second question asks whether or not the time is in the
<emphasis>middle</emphasis> of doing the homework. And the third question
asks whether the time is after the <emphasis>end</emphasis> of doing
the homework, or not.</para>

<para>The term in linguistics for situating the beginnings and ends of
events is <wordasword>aspect</wordasword>. The term Lojban uses is
<wordasword>event contours</wordasword>: events are perceived as shapes,
which have beginnings and ends. (This is why Lojban can use its aspects in
space as well as time, although we won't be going into that here.) In many
languages, aspect is as important as tense, or even more important. In
Russian, to use the best-known example, you cannot use a verb at all
without choosing between a stem indicating that something is (or was, or
will be) still going on (<wordasword>imperfective</wordasword>), and 
stem indicating that something is (or was, or will be) completed 
(<wordasword>perfective</wordasword>). </para>

<para>English isn't like that; yet English has ways of expressing aspect 
anyway. When we say <quote>I have spoken to the doctor</quote>, we are also 
indicating that we have now finished doing so &mdash; we are after the end 
of the event. When we say <quote>I am speaking to the doctor</quote>, on 
the other hand, we are also indicating that we are in between the middle 
and the end of the event: the event is continuing, and is not yet over.</para>

<note><para>Aspect is quite independent of tense: you can say that
something will be over some time in the future (<quote>I will have spoken
to the doctor [by then]</quote>), or that something was continuing in the
past (<quote>I was speaking to the doctor</quote>), without giving any
indication of what is happening in the here and now.</para></note>

<para>Lojban uses <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase>
belonging to <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> ZAhO
to express event contours. You use them just like tense words; if you use
both, the tense word goes first. The three-way distinction we made &mdash;
before the beginning, in the middle, after the end &mdash; is made with
three distinct words: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pu'o, ca'o,
ba'o</foreignphrase>. This is, of course, no coincidence:
<emphasis>before</emphasis> (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">pu</foreignphrase>) an event begins, you use
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pu'o</foreignphrase>; after
(<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ba</foreignphrase>) an event ends, you
use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ba'o</foreignphrase>. So you can come 
up with sentences like these:

<informalexample>
<literallayout>
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi ba'o tavla le mikce</foreignphrase>
I have spoken to the doctor (or had spoken, or will have spoken)
</literallayout>
</informalexample>

<informalexample>

<sect1 id="less12moreasp"><title>More Aspects, and Potentialities</title>

<para>The aspects <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pu'o</foreignphrase> and
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ba'o</foreignphrase> describe situations 
in which the event is still not going on, or no longer going on: if you 
draw a time-line, they are outside of the line corresponding to the event. 
But beginnings and endings are pretty conspicious, as moments go. So we 
often want to point out that we are not before the beginning of the event, 
but at the point when it begins; and not after the end of the event, but at 
the point when it ends.
</para>

<para>To pinpoint your time at the point when the event begins, the aspect
word you use is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">co'a</foreignphrase>. So
you can say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi co'a tcidu le
cukta</foreignphrase> at the moment when you start reading a book. When you
stop reading the book, the aspect is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">co'u</foreignphrase>. When you finish reading, on the
other hand, the word to use is <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mo'u</foreignphrase>. So Lojban make a distinction
between finishing and stopping (before the event would have finished
normally).</para>

<para>For this kind of aspect, English normally just uses verbs: 
<wordasword>start</wordasword>, <wordasword>finish</wordasword>, 
<wordasword>stop</wordasword>. Lojban likewise allows you to use distinct <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> to express these notions: <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">cfari</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">mulno</foreignphrase>, and <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">sisti</foreignphrase>. Using aspects just lets you 
express things more succinctly; and with Lojban the way it is, anything 
that makes things more succinct comes in handy.</para>

<para>There are more aspects in Lojban, though you won't necessarily see 
them as often in Lojban text; you can find out about them in Chapter 10 of 
<citetitle>The Complete Lojban Language</citetitle>.  
</para>

<para>There is another group of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">cmavo</foreignphrase>, though, worth looking at; they are
considered a kind of tense in Lojban, though most languages deal with them
differently. These are the words corresponding to
<wordasword>could</wordasword> and <wordasword>can</wordasword>. We already 
know that there is a <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">kakne</foreignphrase>, which conveys the idea of <quote 
role="gloss">can</quote>. But this doesn't clearly distinguish between 
<quote role="gloss">can</quote> and <quote role="gloss">could</quote>. And 
introducing <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">kakne lenu</foreignphrase> makes sentences unnecessarily 
complex, because it brings with it an extra level of nesting.</para>

<para>So Lojban has <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> CAhA, which contains equivalents
of <quote role="gloss">can</quote>, treated as tenses (they come after any
time and aspect words in a sentence.) There are four such words.

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ka'e</foreignphrase> is the equivalent of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">kakne</foreignphrase> and <wordasword>can</wordasword>. 
It says that the event in the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase> <emphasis>can</emphasis> happen; 
but it doesn't say if it actually has happened.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">nu'o</foreignphrase> says that the event can happen, but 
hasn't (or at least, hasn't yet.) This is at least one sense of 
<wordasword>could</wordasword>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">pu'i</foreignphrase> says that the event can happen, and 
in fact <emphasis>has</emphasis> happened. This one you won't see as often.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Finally, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ca'a</foreignphrase> dispenses with all thought of
potentiality and hypotheticality. There's no <wordasword>can</wordasword>'s
or <wordasword>could</wordasword>'s about the event: it is actually
taking place.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

So if for some reason you wish to exclaim <quote>I can eat a worm</quote>, you would normally say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi ka'e citka lo curnu</foreignphrase>. If you are 
exultantly jumping up and down after giving a practical demonstration that 
you can, indeed, eat a worm, you can also say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi pu'i citka lo curnu</foreignphrase>. While performing 
this act of derring-do, you <emphasis>could</emphasis> say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi ca'a citka lo curnu</foreignphrase> &mdash; but it'd 
be impolite to speak with your mouth full. (Sorry.) Wistfully thinking back on your deeds, 
though, you could later say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi pu ca'a citka lo curnu</foreignphrase>. In those 
happy days, finally, when eating worms was just a remote hypothesis, you 
might have wanted to say <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi nu'o citka lo curnu</foreignphrase> &mdash; just to 
make it clear that you haven't actually gone ahead and done it yet.

</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="less12voc"><title>Vocatives</title>

<para>When you address people by name, you usually do so to make it clear
whom out of a group you are talking to. We've already seen how to do that
in Lojban: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">doi</foreignphrase>, followed
by the name (without the name article, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">la</foreignphrase>.) So <quote>Houston, we have a
problem</quote> ends up as <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">doi xustyn. mi'a
se nabmi</foreignphrase> (sidestepping the slight illogicality of speaking
to a single person in Houston but addressing a whole city.)</para>

<para>Often, however, we address people in order to manage our 
conversations: to make someone pay attention to our turn; to butt in 
before it is our turn; to signal that a conversation is beginning or ending; 
and so on. We can also do this without using names, but instead by various 
context cues and all-purpose words. When you think about it, for example, 
<wordasword>OK</wordasword> does a lot of work for such a small word.</para>

<para>As we know, Lojban tends to be precise rather than vague. So when it 
comes to signalling what you want done with a conversation, Lojban doesn't 
play along with the usual natural language tricks of leaving it up to 
politeness and social convention to work out what's going on. Instead, it 
has explicit words for managing turns in a conversation, which can optionally be followed 
by the name of whoever you're bringing it to the attention of. Since all 
these words address someone, they are called 
<wordasword>vocatives</wordasword> (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> COI.)</para>

<para>Natural languages don't distinguish as carefully between these 
various contexts, expect in fairly artificial contexts: for example, 
conversations over two-way radio, where it is impossible to talk over each 
other, or to negotatiate whose turn it is to speak with subtle visual 
cues. (A less elaborate vocabulary is in place for IRC, its Internet 
equivalent.) 
This means that Lojban looks a little like a CB enthusiast's nightmare, 
because the glosses you see for these vocatives come from this more 
explicit subset of English. But normal English has these kinds of words as 
well &mdash; they're just not as clearly distinguished, because context is 
usually relied on instead.</para>

<para>We've slipped some of these past you already, too. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mi'e</foreignphrase> is the word you use to introduce
yourself: it's the only vocative followed by the speaker's name, rather
than the addressee's. So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi'e
.robin.</foreignphrase> means <quote>I'm Robin</quote> or <quote>This is
Robin speaking.</quote> <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">coi</foreignphrase> is the greeting word: it corresponds
to <quote>Hello</quote>, <quote>Good morning</quote>, <quote>Hi</quote>,
<quote>Wazzup?</quote>, and whatever else happens to be in vogue.
Conversely, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">co'o</foreignphrase> is the
farewell word, corresponding to <quote>Goodbye</quote>,
<quote>Farewell</quote>, <quote>Yo later, dude</quote>, and so on.
Lojbanists signing off on e-mail often end with something like
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">co'omi'e .robin.</foreignphrase> &mdash; 
this is equivalent to putting your name at the end of your email in 
English as a signature, and translates as <quote>Goodbye; I'm Robin.</quote></para>

<para>The other vocatives are not as common. Two words similar to
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">coi</foreignphrase> are <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ju'i</foreignphrase> <quote role="gloss">Hey!</quote>,
with which you draw someone's attention, and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fi'i</foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">Welcome!</quote>, with which you offer hospitality. (It's what
you say to a visitor; you wouldn't say it over the phone, for instance,
unless they're calling from the airport and are on their way over.) </para>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">je'e</foreignphrase> corresponds to
<quote role="gloss">Roger!</quote> in radio-speak, and <quote
role="gloss">right</quote> or <quote role="gloss">uh-uh</quote> in normal
English: it confirms that you've received a message. If you haven't, you
say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">je'enai</foreignphrase> instead (of
course); in normal English, that would be <quote role="gloss">Beg your
pardon?</quote> or <quote role="gloss">Huh?</quote>. You can
explicitly ask for the speaker to repeat whatever they said with
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ke'o</foreignphrase>.</para>

<para>Similarly, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">be'e</foreignphrase>
signals a request to send a message (<quote>Hello? Are you there?</quote>),
and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">re'i</foreignphrase> indicates that
you are ready to receive a message. (It's what you say when you pick up the
phone &mdash; which in English also happens to be <quote>Hello?</quote>,
but in Italian is <foreignphrase lang="ita">Pronto</foreignphrase> <quote
role="gloss">Ready!</quote>.)</para>

<para><foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">mu'o</foreignphrase> is what you say when you explictly
make it another speaker's turn to speak: it's the <quote>Over!</quote> of
radio. When it isn't your turn to speak, but you want to barge in anyway,
you can say <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ta'a</foreignphrase> &mdash;
though it probably won't make anyone any happier that you're interrupting.
</para>

<para><foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">nu'e</foreignphrase> introduces a
promise; <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pe'u</foreignphrase> introduces a
request, and so is fairly similar to the attitudinal <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.e'o</foreignphrase>. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">vi'o</foreignphrase> acknowledges a request, and promises
to carry it out: in radio talk this is <quote>Wilco!</quote>, and in normal
English <quote>OK</quote> or <quote>All right, I will</quote> (or for that
matter, <quote>Consider it done!</quote>)</para>

<para>You say <quote>Thank you</quote>
with <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">ki'e</foreignphrase> &mdash; to which
the appropriate response is <emphasis>not</emphasis> <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fi'i</foreignphrase> (<quote>You're welcome</quote>
doesn't mean you're being visited by some guests), but the simple
acknowledgement <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">je'e</foreignphrase>.</para>

<para>Finally, to close communication (radio's <quote>Over and out!</quote>), you
can use <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">fe'o</foreignphrase>. (This is what people actually <emphasis>should</emphasis> be putting at the end of their e-mails; but it's not as well-known a word as <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">co'o</foreignphrase>)</para>

<para>Vocatives take names (after an obligatory pause), or <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> describing the addressee (e.g. <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">co'o mensi</foreignphrase> 
<quote>Goodbye, sister!</quote>); so they normally
don't need terminators. If you do need a terminator, though &mdash;
especially if you're dropping the name out &mdash; the terminator for
vocatives is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">do'u</foreignphrase>.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less12fuhivla"><title>Loan words</title>

<para>You got a brief taste of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> in <link linkend="less8">Lesson
8</link>. As we said there, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> are the main way of introducing new
words &mdash; more precisely, new <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> &mdash; into Lojban. The most
important thing about <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> is that, as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, they are meant to have very
well-defined place structures; and there are suggestions in place for
deriving them (see <citetitle>The Complete Lojban Language</citetitle>, Chapter 12.) So, particularly when the concept you want to express is <quote
role="socalled">verb-like</quote> (that is, when it's likely to have
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> of its own), <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">lujvo</foreignphrase> are preferred.</para>

<para>There are some cases, though, when you do have to borrow a word from
another language. This can be because the thing you're talking about is
very concrete or particular, and/or because the reference is quite
culture-specific. In either case, it would be really cumbersome to describe
it with a combination of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase>. (For example, how would you come
up with a description for <wordasword>brie</wordasword>? Or
<wordasword>rock 'n' roll</wordasword>? &mdash; which, we should point out,
you would have to keep distinct from <wordasword>rock</wordasword>!)</para>

<para>The problem with borrowing words into Lojban is, Lojban has a quite 
thorough set-up for working out what the words are in a stream of letters. 
This means that most words you import into Lojban (once you spell them in 
Lojban letters) are likely to mean something else already. For 
example, if I want to bring the word <wordasword>Esperanto</wordasword> into 
Lojban, the last thing I want to do is start saying <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.esperanto</foreignphrase>. That will get analysed as <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">.e speranto</foreignphrase>, which is something like 
<quote role="gloss">and marriage-soft</quote>. (Well, it would be if <quote 
role="gloss">soft</quote> was <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ranto</foreignphrase> instead of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">ranti</foreignphrase> &mdash; but the point should still 
be clear: importing words as they are would lead to confusion and havoc.)</para>

<para>The sanctioned way to deal with loan-words (described in more detail
in <citetitle>The Complete Lojban Language</citetitle>, Chapter 4.7) is to stick a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> (minus its final
letter) in front of the word, showing what sort of thing the word
is; and to put an <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase> (or,
if an <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase> is already there,
an <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">n</foreignphrase>) between the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> and the word. The
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> helps the
reader or listener, who has likely never seen this word before,
guess what the word might be. (This is particularly handy if the source
word might be ambiguous between two different meanings.) And the
combination of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gismu</foreignphrase> minus
final vowel, source word (which should start with a consonant, and end with
a vowel), and <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase> or
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">n</foreignphrase> will hopefully produce a
cluster of consonants crunchy enough that it cannot be mistaken for another
Lojban word or phrase.)</para>

<para>So what does all this look like in practice? Well, we've already seen
<wordasword>curry</wordasword>: take <quote role="gloss">food</quote>,
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">cidj[a]</foreignphrase>; take the word in 
Lojban garb (starting with a consonant and ending with a vowel), <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">kari</foreignphrase>; and wedge them together with an <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase>: <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">cidjrkari</foreignphrase>.  (The consonant cluster is also crunchy enough to be difficult to 
pronounce; the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">r</foreignphrase> is a 
syllable on its own, and the word should sound something like 
<wordasword>shidgerrrrrkari</wordasword>.)</para>

<para>Loan words (in Lojban, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase>) are still only sporadically
used &mdash; particularly because, as of this writing at least, there is no Lojban
dictionary where a standard list of them can be looked up. The problem of
which language to borrow words from is also hard to settle, and the choices
made can cause problems of their own. The most international solution for
plant and animal names, for example, is Latin, and in particular the Latin
of the Linnaean system of classification. But this means that, to come up
with a word for <quote role="gloss">catnip</quote>, say, you have to know
Latin and your Linnaean taxonomy (Or, like I did, look it up on the
Internet &mdash; but you can't normally do that while you're having a
conversation.) So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase>
are still largely unexplored terrain in Lojban.</para>

<note><para>That said, you will occasionally see <quote
role="socalled">Stage 4</quote> <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase> in use. The <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">fu'ivla</foreignphrase> we've seen are <quote
role="socalled">Stage 3</quote>; in Stage 4, you drop the initial <quote
role="socalled">crunchy</quote> <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">rafsi</foreignphrase>, reasoning that the word should
already be well-known or recognisable enough. (For example, <citetitle>The
Complete Lojban Language</citetitle> suggests <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">tci'ile</foreignphrase> for <quote role="gloss">Chile</quote>,
instead of <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">gugdrtcile</foreignphrase>.)
Not everyone likes them, so they're not yet all that common, and you'll
usually get plenty of warning if someone is using them. </para></note>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="less12eq"><title>Equalities</title>

<para>You may at some stage have asked yourself the question, what the
Lojban for <wordasword>is</wordasword> is. The short answer is, most of the
time there isn't one. Lojban represents the world in terms of relations
(<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">bridi</foreignphrase>), and
<wordasword>is</wordasword> is a fairly empty kind of relation. Moreover,
if the thing to the right of <wordasword>is</wordasword> (the <quote
role="socalled">predicate</quote>, in grammar terminology) means a class of
things, instead of a single entity, then it corresponds to a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, and we don't need to put a word
for <wordasword>is</wordasword> in. So <quote>Robin 
<emphasis>is</emphasis> English</quote> comes out in Lojban as <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">la robin. cu glico</foreignphrase>: <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">glico</foreignphrase> is already a <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> that takes <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">la robin.</foreignphrase> as a <foreignphrase 
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> &mdash; so we don't need a separate 
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> for 
<wordasword>is</wordasword>.
</para>

<para>Very, very, <emphasis>very</emphasis> occasionally, you'll need a 
Lojban word for <wordasword>is</wordasword> anyway. Lojban offers three 
words which sort of do the job of <wordasword>is</wordasword>; each has its 
own provisos.
</para>

<para>The first word is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase>.
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase> takes a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> following it, and converts it into
a <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>. So
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me la nik.</foreignphrase> is a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, which takes as a
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> anything that <quote
role="socalled">is a Nick</quote>. Similarly, since <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">le mi ci mensi</foreignphrase> is <quote role="gloss">my
three sisters</quote>, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la renas. me le mi
ci mensi</foreignphrase> means <quote>Rena is one of my three
sisters</quote> (as she is described by the <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> version of <quote role="gloss">my three
sisters</quote>.) So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase> is 
best thought of as meaning <quote role="gloss">is one of</quote>.</para>

<para>The second word is <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">du</foreignphrase>.
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">du</foreignphrase> is a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase> on its own, and it means that all
its <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> are the same
thing and have the same identity. So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi du
la nik.</foreignphrase> (or <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">mi du la
robin.</foreignphrase>) is a way of saying <quote>I am Robin (or
Nick.)</quote> The claim made is one of identity; so you can flip the
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> around without
making any difference: <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la robin. du mi</foreignphrase>. It does <emphasis>not</emphasis> make a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> behave like a <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selbri</foreignphrase>, so <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">du</foreignphrase> cannot mean <quote role="gloss">is one
of</quote>, like <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">me</foreignphrase> does:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la renas. du le mi ci
mensi</foreignphrase> makes the nonsensical claim that Rena
<emphasis>is</emphasis> my three sisters. (Or should that be
<wordasword>are</wordasword>?)</para>

<para>These two means are grammatical Lojban, but they are viewed with some
distaste, and are usually giveaways that some poor translating from English
(or another natural language) has been going on. The third mechanism is
better regarded, though, because it tucks the equality away in a corner.
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase> has the same grammar
as the <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> modifiers
like <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">pe</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po</foreignphrase> we saw in <link linkend="less3">Lesson
3.</link> But instead of claiming that one <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase> is associated with the other, or
owned by the other, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase>
claims that the two <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">sumti</foreignphrase>
are the same thing. So <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la ranjit.
<emphasis>po'u</emphasis> le pendo be la djiotis. vi zvati</foreignphrase>
means <quote>Ranjeet, <emphasis>who is</emphasis> Jyoti's friend, is
here.</quote> Like those other members of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">selma'o</foreignphrase> GOI (<foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">pe</foreignphrase>, <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po</foreignphrase> and <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po'e</foreignphrase>), <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase> has a non-restrictive version:
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">no'u</foreignphrase>. So if I was saying
that Ranjeet was Jyoti's friend, not to distinguish him from the other
Ranjeets you know, but just for your information, I should use
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">no'u</foreignphrase> instead of
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase>.</para>

perfectly acceptable beverages &mdash; had not necessarily reached that
point, anyway. If you wanted to keep the umlaut, you could also use
<foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">la'o dy. G&uuml;nter dy.</foreignphrase>,
or something like that. We presume this is the only G&uuml;nter they know,
so his nickname isn't being used to distinguish him from other
G&uuml;nters; hence, <foreignphrase lang="art-lojban">no'u</foreignphrase>
instead of <foreignphrase
lang="art-lojban">po'u</foreignphrase>.)</para></listitem>
