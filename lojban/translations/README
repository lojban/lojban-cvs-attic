The directories that are populated so far:

alice/		Lewis Carrol's "Alice's Adventures In Wonderland",
		texinfo format.
drbible/	The Douay-Rheims version of the Bible, texinfo format.
german/		Translating brochures into german, XML format.

In general, please do _not_ start at the beginning of whatever you're
working on (i.e. I started translating Alice with Chapter 5).  Everyone
will, by default, be inclined to start at the beginning, and that gets
_ugly_.

Ah, important point.

I think that people should _absolutely_ edit other people's work.
Hopefully things will eventually settle on the 'best' translation.  So
please, read what other people have done!

However, I do request that when you do so you put a comment (@c at th
beginning of the line marks comments) saying why you made the change.

> Changes are not recorded, right?

They most certainly _are_ recorded, this is the whole point of using
CVS.  I can revert to _any_ previous version if people give me a good
reason to do so (i.e. you accidentally checked in a version with most of
the text missing).

Notes on TexInfo
================

Lines that start with '@c ' or '@comment ' are comments, that will
show up in none of the compiled versions.  The original text has been
placed in lines of this type, with break for paragraphs.

To help with the translation, simply pick a paragraph and enter the
lojban text, straight up, _without_ '@c ' or any other markup,
_after_ the original paragraph.  Almost all the markup this file
needs has already been done for you.

Note that there should be a blank line before and after each
paragraph.

To deal with places where the exact layout of the text is important
(just about any poetry, for example), place the command '@format' before
the text and '@end format' at the end.
