New in version 0.37
===================

(updated as far as 18 June).

general
=======
- Include contributed Emacs Lisp functions for driving jbofi'e.
- Add fold markers in some of the source code for editing with VIM version 6

jbofihe
=======
- Improve translations of vowels & other words followed by "bu".  (Only a
  partial list is included in the extradict file.)
- Fix crashes which occurred when tagging term places when the selbri was "jai"
  followed by something other than a brivla.
- Add entries for mu'e, pu'u, za'i, zu'o to the 'patterns' file for use in
  glossing unknown lujvo.
- Integrate recognition of cultural rafsi in lujvo into the ordinary state
  machine (so now 1 integrated state machine instead of 2 separate ones).
  Consequent reduction in table sizes.
- Fix bug : missing 'break' statements causing fall-through and hence bogus
  access on another branch of a union.
- Deprecate -g command option from man page.

vlatai
======
- For stage 3 fu'ivla, show forward slashes to split the rafsi prefix from the
  hyphen and the hyphen from the word tail.
- Recognize an extension to stage 3 fu'ivla, with >1 rafsi before the hyphen
- Cultural rafsi scanning improvement as for jbofihe.  Remove -cr command line
  argument.
- Only show exit value of state machine in verbose (-v) mode.
- Detect and show bad cmene forms (la/lai/doi break-up)

lexer generator (n2d/*)
===============
- Add handling of 'state attributes' (to allow actions to be run when automaton
  is in DFA states corresponding to particular NFA states)
- Fix bug in NFA compressor, where algorithm could run off the end of an array.
- Fix bug in DFA compressor (was functionally correct but over-pessimistic
  about combining states)
- Improve command line options
- Add %{ ... %} text inclusion facility
- Allow exit and attribute table element types to be defined by input grammar
- Add 'early exit' capability for DFA states that will immediately exit (=>
  reduced table sizes + more state merging)
- Provide next_state functions in the output file.

New in version 0.36
===================

- Fixed Makefile portability problems discovered in v0.35
- Fix bug where cmavo sequences like nytysy were not recognized (where removing
  y leaves invalid triple)
- Fix bug where the words y, yyyyy, y'y were not recognized as valid cmavo
- Fix bug for -se option applied to nu'u in the middle of a termset.
- Fix bug for -se option applied to elidables with a sequence of 'free'
  constructs following them.
- Fix bugs for -se option applied to boi & ve'o
- Fix several bugs people sent me where jbofihe crashed or generated bad output
  for various small examples.
- Fix bugs scanning cmene containing ..nydz.., ..y,y.. etc
- Many improvements to lexical analyser builder (n2d subdirectory) -
  * generate smaller tables by relying on binary searching in the target app.
  * compress state machines by grouping equivalent DFA states together input
  * input file can specify priority logic to resolve ambiguous accepting states
  * syntax capabilities of input file greatly enhanced
  * processing speed much improved
  (This tool can now be considered a standalone project in its own right,
  except for the lack of documentation on it.)
- Fix bugs in scanner's fu'ivla recognition (including length of consonant
  clusters).
- Recognise stage 3 and stage 4 fu'ivla separately to improve glossing
  performance.
- Allow consonant+comma+vowel triples within words.
- Include configure option --embed to allow a minimal dictionary to be embedded
  into the jbofihe executable (=> no separate dictionary file required at
  runtime)
- Add handling of zei (completely missing before)
- Add configure option --embed, to allow the gismu+cmavo dictionary to be
  compiled directly into the jbofihe executable.  (No run-time dictionary is
  then needed, however there is no capability to add new definitions in this
  mode)
- Simplify consonant doubling before -er and -ing suffices in the translator.
- Added configure script, to help people who just want to 'build+go' without
  reading the docs.
- Switch to GNU General Public License (replaces customised zlib/BSD-like
  license)
- Detect zoi/la'o constructions left open at the end of the text.

New in version 0.35
===================

(Changes apply to jbofihe unless stated otherwise)

- Add support to show elidable cmavo that were omitted from the input text (-ie
  command switch).  (Cmavo inserted this way are displayed in upper case in the
  output).
- Add option to require that the input text does not have any cmavo elided (-re
  command switch).  (This may be useful as a learning aid and when trying to
  debug grammar failures.)
- Add option to report any elidable cmavo which are superfluous in the text,
  accessed with the -se comand switch.  Where a sequence of such words can be
  partially omitted, all possible 'minimal' sub-sequences are shown.  A verbose
  option (-sev) gives extra visibility of how the algorithm makes its decisions
  about valid minimal sequences.
- Totally rewritten algorithm for determining type (cmavo, brivla, cmene etc)
  of input words.  Should now enforce word structure rules 100%, and be
  competely robust at removing cmavo prefixed onto the front of gismu, lujvo
  and fu'ivla.  The testbench for this part of the program is bundled as a
  separate tool (vlatai).  Acceptance of cultural rafsi (section 4.16 of the
  Reference Grammar) is optional (-cr switch).
- Add backtracing mode for showing the parser stack when a syntax error occurs
  (-bt option).  May assist in debugging syntactically invalid texts.
- Changed approach to building the glossing dictionary for jbofihe and cmafihe.
  The gismu and cmavo information is now bundled with the source.  The 2 lujvo
  files are also used if they are found in the current directory at build time.
  This avoids the user having to download extra files to get a minimal working
  installation.
- Add case tagging for selbri involving MOI, GOhA, NUhA
- Fix bugs parsing number/lerfu-string containing bu followed by
  moi/mei/roi/re'u
- Fix printing of 'bu' construction on token list following a parse error.
- Fix output translation if a 'bu' construction occurs in a number/lerfu
  sequence before MOI.
- Attempt output translation of zo, zoi, bu etc. constructions.
- Fix inability to parse pe'a.
- Fix inability to parse fu'e.
- Default output width (-w argument) for text output changed to 79 instead of
  80.
- Fix core dump illustrated by a text containing a single cmavo which causes a
  parse error.
- Return status from main() to the shell reflects whether there was a parse
  error or not.
- Show misparsed token as well as previously parsed ones after a parse error is
  found.
- Fix line numbering across comments and when token follows whitespace or
  comment.
- Cope with multiple BAhE cmavo before a word (previously only the closest one
  was shown in outputs)
- Implement erasure processing described in the Refgram. (for 'su' as described
  in grammar.300 file)
- Deal properly with cmene which violate the rule about la/lai/doi appearing
  internally.
- Port to MSDOS environment (using DJGPP toolchain); binary release for MSDOS.
- Allow whether to use fread or mmap to access dictionary to be specified at
  configure time.
- Open certain files in binary mode instead of text (support DJGPP port)
- Change name of default dictionary (support DJGPP port)
- Make banners for 'jbofihe -k' option go to stdout not stderr (so they now
  flow amongst the token list)
- Given an advisory message when a core dump would previously have happened.
- Update various details in manual pages
- Allow carriage return characters at ends of lines (cmafihe)
- Further fixes to translation of pre-hyphen part of type 3 fu'ivla
- Fixes to translation of time_offset when specific entries lacking from
  dictionary.
- Support the cmavo va'e (mentioned in reference grammar yet not in word lists)
- Allow directory containing word lists to be specified to configure script,
  rather than having to be searched for.  
- Fix bug in jvocuhadju where the 4 forbidden triples starting with 'n' weren't
  being detected.
- Various minor bug fixes.
  
New in version 0.34

- Add support + translations for the cmavo that were missing from the original
  cmavo list
- Fix bugs in handling certain cmavo when followed by an indicator (e.g. mi se
  cai zdile)

  be translated.

New in version 0.32a
====================

- Fix major bugs in the lexical analysis for cmafi'e (brivla mis-scanned as
  sequences of cmavo joined together.)

New in version 0.32

  the following brivla.
- Fix bug with pei not being handled properly.

  etc.
