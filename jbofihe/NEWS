New in version 0.35
===================

(Changes apply to jbofihe unless stated otherwise)

- Add support to show elidable cmavo that were omitted from the input text (-ie
  command switch).  (Cmavo inserted this way are displayed in upper case in the
  output).
- Add option to require the input text to contain every elidable cmavo (-re
  command switch).  (This may be useful as a learning aid and when trying to
  debug grammar failures.)
- Add option to report any elidable cmavo which are superfluous in the text,
  accessed with the -se comand switch.  Where a sequence of such words can be
  partially omitted, all possible 'minimal' sub-sequences are shown.
- Totally rewritten algorithm for determining type (cmavo, brivla, cmene etc)
  of input words.  Should now enforce word structure rules 100%, and be
  competely robust at removing cmavo prefixed onto the front of gismu, lujvo
  and fu'ivla.  The testbench for this part of the program is bundled as a
  separate tool (vlatai).  Acceptance of cultural rafsi (section 4.16 of the
  Reference Grammar) is optional (-cr switch).
- Add backtracing mode for showing the parser stack when a syntax error occurs
  (-bt option).  May assist in debugging syntactically invalid texts.
- Add case tagging for selbri involving MOI, GOhA, NUhA
- Fix bugs parsing number/lerfu-string containing bu followed by
  moi/mei/roi/re'u
- Fix printing of 'bu' construction on token list following a parse error.
- Fix output translation if a 'bu' construction occurs in a number/lerfu
  sequence before MOI.
- Attempt output translation of zo, zoi, bu etc. constructions.
- Fix inability to parse pe'a.
- Fix inability to parse fu'e.
- Default output width (-w argument) for text output changed to 79 instead of
  80.
- Fix core dump illustrated by a text containing a single cmavo which causes a
  parse error.
- Return status from main() to the shell reflects whether there was a parse
  error or not.
- Show misparsed token as well as previously parsed ones after a parse error is
  found.
- Fix line numbering across comments and when token follows whitespace or
  comment.
- Cope with multiple BAhE cmavo before a word (previously only the closest one
  was shown in outputs)
- Implement erasure processing described in the Refgram. (for 'su' as described
  in grammar.300 file)
- Deal properly with cmene which violate the rule about la/lai/doi appearing
  internally.
- Port to MSDOS environment (using DJGPP toolchain); binary release for MSDOS.
- Allow whether to use fread or mmap to access dictionary to be specified at
  configure time.
- Open certain files in binary mode instead of text (support DJGPP port)
- Change name of default dictionary (support DJGPP port)
- Make banners for 'jbofihe -k' option go to stdout not stderr (so they now
  flow amongst the token list)
- Given an advisory message when a core dump would previously have happened.
- Update various details in manual pages
- Allow carriage return characters at ends of lines (cmafihe)
- Further fixes to translation of pre-hyphen part of type 3 fu'ivla
- Fixes to translation of time_offset when specific entries lacking from
  dictionary.
- Support the cmavo va'e (mentioned in reference grammar yet not in word lists)
- Allow directory containing word lists to be specified to configure script,
  rather than having to be searched for.  
- Fix bug in jvocuhadju where the 4 forbidden triples starting with 'n' weren't
  being detected.
- Various minor bug fixes.
  
New in version 0.34
===================

- Add support + translations for the cmavo that were missing from the original
  cmavo list
- Fix bugs in handling certain cmavo when followed by an indicator (e.g. mi se
  cai zdile)
- Fix bugs in cases when constructions involving lu, bu, lo'u...le'u, zo, zoi
  etc are nested.

New in version 0.33
===================

- Support for the 'term ::= tag termset' rule discussed on the Egroups list
  around the start of June 2000.
- Fix bug splitting cmavo from front of brivla
- Fix bug translating fu'ivla when the 'Lojbanic' part before the hyphen can't
  be translated.

New in version 0.32a
====================

- Fix major bugs in the lexical analysis for cmafi'e (brivla mis-scanned as
  sequences of cmavo joined together.)

New in version 0.32
===================

- Add capability to jbofi'e to parse texts where cmavo have been prefixed onto
  the following brivla.
- Fix bug with pei not being handled properly.

New in version 0.31
===================

- Add pattern matching scheme to jbofi'e translater, which recognizes and
  provides default translations for standard lujvo forms, e.g. -mau, -gau, nun-
  etc.
