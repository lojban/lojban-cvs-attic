.SH DESCRIPTION
.I jbofihe
is a program that reads a piece of Lojban text and checks it for
grammatical correctness.  If it passes, the output will show the
nesting of the major grammatical constructs by means of bracketing.
Also, words will have their approximate English translations shown.
Some of these translations are context-dependent.
